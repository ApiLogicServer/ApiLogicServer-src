    TBD Observe the logic log to see that it creates audit rows:

    1. **Discouraged:** you can implement auditing with events.  But auditing is a common pattern, and this can lead to repetitive, tedious code
    2. **Preferred:** approaches use [extensible rules](https://github.com/valhuber/LogicBank/wiki/Rule-Extensibility#generic-event-handlers).

    Generic event handlers can also reduce redundant code, illustrated in the time/date stamping `handle_all` logic.

    This is due to the `copy_row` rule.  Contrast this to the *tedious* `audit_by_event` alternative:

    > **Key Takeaway:** use **extensible own rule types** to automate pattern you identify; events can result in tedious amounts of code.
