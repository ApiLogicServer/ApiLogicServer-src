# Getting Started with Genai-Logic react apps

GenAI-Logic (`genai-logic genai-add-app`) [docs here](https://apilogicserver.github.io/Docs/Admin-Vibe/), from `ui/admin/admin.yaml`.

We then *Vibed it* to add cards:

```bash
Update the Customer list to provide users an option to see results in a list, or in cards
```

# To run the app:

```bash
# security for react apps in progress, disable for now...
genai-logic add-auth --provider-type=None
cd ui/react-admin
npm install
npm start
```
