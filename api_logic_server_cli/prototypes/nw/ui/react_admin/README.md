# Getting Started with Genai-Logic react-admin

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).  For more information, see [README_create_react_app](README_create_react_app.md).

GenAI-Logic (`als genai-app`) then [created this project](https://apilogicserver.github.io/Docs/Admin-Vibe/).

Repairs were required: search `src` for #FIXEDME.  It started but failed to run.

# To run the app:

```bash
cd ui/react-admin
npm install
npm start
```
