# Getting Started with Genai-Logic react apps

GenAI-Logic created this app (`genai-logic genai-add-app`) [(docs here)](https://apilogicserver.github.io/Docs/Admin-Vibe/), typically from `ui/admin/admin.yaml`.

We then use CoPilot to add cards, as described in `readme_vibe.md`:

# To run the app:

```bash
# security for react apps in progress, disable for now...
genai-logic add-auth --provider-type=None
cd ui/react-admin
npm install
npm start
```
