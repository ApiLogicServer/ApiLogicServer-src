title: Instant Microservices - with Logic and Security
notes: gold is proto (-- doc); alert for apostrophe
version: 0.7 from pip
---

See how to build a complete database system -- in minutes instead of weeks or months:

1. **An API**, and, we'll add ui and logic to make it a microservice...
2. **Logic and Security:** multi-table constraints and derivations, and role-based security
3. **An Admin App:** and finally, a multi-page, multi-table web app

We'll use API Logic Server (open source), providing:

| Key Feature | Providing | Why It Matters|
| :--- |:---|:---|
| **Automation** | Instant Project Creation:<br>An API and an Admin web app  | Unblock UI App Dev<br>Instant Agile Collaboration |
| **Customization** | Declarative logic and security <br> 5 rules vs. 200 lines of Python | 40X less backend code |
| **Iteration** | Revising the data model, and <br>Adding rules plus Python | Iterative development <br> Extensiblity with Python |

The entire process takes 10 minutes, instead of several weeks using traditional development.

You can use this article in several ways:

* Conceptual Overview - focus on the basic process.  Operational details are moved to the Appendix to retain focus on the concepts.

* Self-demo - you can create this system yourself.

* Self-demo with video - you can also use [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sD6RFp8S6Fg) (it's the same system, but the database is created with ChatGPT).

&nbsp;

## 1. Automation: Instant Project

This project was created with a command like:

```bash
$ ApiLogicServer create --project_name=basic_demo --db_url=basic_demo
```

> Note: the `db_url` value is [an abbreviation](https://apilogicserver.github.io/Docs/Data-Model-Examples/).  You would normally supply a SQLAlchemy URI.

This creates a project by reading your schema.  The database is Customer, Orders, Items and Product, as shown in the Appendix.  

You can open with VSCode, and run it as follows:

1. **Create Virtual Environment:** as shown in the Appendix.

2. **Start the Server:** F5 (also described in the Appendix).

3. **Start the Admin App:** either use the links provided in the IDE console, or click [http://localhost:5656/](http://localhost:5656/).  The screen shown below should appear in your Browser.

The sections below explore the system that has been created (which would be similar for your own database).

&nbsp;

### API with Swagger

The system creates an API with end points for each table, with filtering, sorting, pagination, optimistic locking and related data access -- **[self-serve](https://apilogicserver.github.io/Docs/API-Self-Serve/), ready for custom app dev.**

<img src="https://github.com/ApiLogicServer/Docs/blob/main/docs/images/basic_demo/api-swagger.jpeg?raw=true">

### Admin App

It also creates an Admin App: multi-page, multi-table apps -- ready for **[business user agile collaboration](https://apilogicserver.github.io/Docs/Tech-AI/),** and back office data maintenance.  This complements custom UIs created with the API.

You can click Customer 2, see their Orders, and Items.

<img src="https://github.com/ApiLogicServer/Docs/blob/main/docs/images/basic_demo/admin-app-initial.jpeg?raw=true">

## 2. Customize in your IDE

While API/UI automation is a great start, it's critical to enforce logic and security.  Here's how.

The follwing `apply_customizations` process simulates adding security to your project, and using your IDE to declare logic and security in `logic/declare_logic.sh` and `security/declare_security.py`.  You can diff these files to their created versions, and/or examine the declared logic.

In a terminal window for your project:

**1. Stop the Server** (Red Stop button, or Shift-F5 -- see Appendix)

**2. Apply Customizations**

```bash
# mac, linux
sh apply_customizations.sh

#windows
./apply_customizations.ps1
```
&nbsp;

### Declare Security

The `apply_customizations` process above has simulated the `ApiLogicServer add-auth` command, and using your IDE to declare security in `logic/declare_logic.sh`.

To see security in action:

**1. Start the Server**  F5

**2. Start the Admin App:** [http://localhost:5656/](http://localhost:5656/)

**3. Login** as `s1`, password `p`

**4. Click Customers**

In the IDE Console Log, observe the how the logging assists in debugging, by showing which Grants (`+ Grant:`) are applied:

&nbsp;

### Declare Logic

Logic (multi-table derivations and constraints) is a significant portion of a system, typically nearly half.  API Logic server provides **spreadsheet-like rules** that dramatically simplify and accelerate logic development.

Rules are declared in Python, simplified with IDE code completion.  The screen below shows the 5 rules for **Check Credit Logic.**

The `apply_customizations` process above has simulated the process of using your IDE to declare logic in `logic/declare_logic.sh`.

To see logic in action:

**1. Test: Start the Server, and use the Admin App to add an Order and Item**

Observe the rules firing in the console log, as shown in the next screenshot.

Logic provides significant improvements over procedural logic, as described below.

&nbsp;

#### a. Complexity Scaling

The screenshot below shows our logic declarations, and the logging for inserting an `Item`.  Each line represents a rule firing, and shows the complete state of the row.

Note that it's `Multi-Table Transaction`, as indicating by the indentation.  This is because - like a spreadsheet - **rules automatically chain, *including across tables.***

<img src="https://github.com/ApiLogicServer/Docs/blob/main/docs/images/basic_demo/logic-chaining.jpeg?raw=true">

#### b. 40X More Concise

The 5 spreadsheet-like rules represent the same logic as 200 lines of code, [shown here](https://github.com/valhuber/LogicBank/wiki/by-code).  That's a remarkable 40X decrease in the backend half of the system.

&nbsp;

#### c. Automatic Re-use

The logic above, perhaps conceived for Place order, applies automatically to all transactions: deleting an order, changing items, moving an order to a new customer, etc.

&nbsp;

#### d. Automatic Optimizations

SQL overhead is minimized by pruning, and by elimination of expensive aggregate queries.  These can result in orders of magnitude impact.

&nbsp;

#### e. Transparent

Rules are an executable design.  Note they map exactly to our natural language design (shown in comments) - readable by business users.  

Optionally, you can use the Behave TDD approach to define tests, and the Rules Report will show the rules that execute for each test.  For more information, [click here](https://apilogicserver.github.io/Docs/Behave-Logic-Report/).

&nbsp;

## 3. Iterate with Rules and Python

Not only are spreadsheet-like rules 40X more concise, they meaningfully simplify maintenance.  Let's take an example:

>> Give a 10% discount for carbon-neutral products for 10 items or more.

The follwing `apply_iteration` process simulates an iteration:

* acquires a new database with `Product.CarbonNeutral`

* and a revised `ui/admin/admin.yaml` that shows this new column

* revised logic - in `logic/declare_logic.py`, we replace the 2 lines for the `models.Item.Amount` formula with this (next screenshot shows revised logic executing with breakpoint):

```python
    def derive_amount(row: models.Item, old_row: models.Item, logic_row: LogicRow):
        amount = row.Quantity * row.UnitPrice
        if row.Product.CarbonNeutral and row.Quantity >= 10:
           amount = amount * Decimal(0.9)  # breakpoint here
        return amount

    Rule.formula(derive=models.Item.Amount, calling=derive_amount)
```

* issues the `ApiLogicServer rebuild-from-database` command that rebuilds your project (the database models, the api), while preserving the customizations we made above.

In a terminal window for your project:

**1. Stop the Server** (Red Stop button, or Shift-F5 -- see Appendix)

**2. Apply Iteration**

```bash
# mac, linux
sh apply_iteration.sh

#windows
./apply_iteration.ps1
```
&nbsp;

**3. Set the breakpoint as shown**

&nbsp;

**4. Test: Start the Server, and use the Admin App to update your Order by adding a `Green` Item**

At the breakpoint, note you can use standard debugger services to debug your logic (examine `Item` attributes, step, etc).

<img src="https://github.com/ApiLogicServer/Docs/blob/main/docs/images/basic_demo/logic-debugging.jpeg?raw=true">

&nbsp;

This simple example illustrates some significant aspects of iteration, described in the sub-sections bdelow.

&nbsp;

### a. Maintenance Automation

Along with perhaps documentation, one of the tasks programmers most loathe is maintenance.  That's because it's not about writing code, but it's mainly archaeology - deciphering code someone else wrote, just so you can add 4 or 5 lines that will hopefully be called and function correctly.

Rules change that, since they **self-order their execution** (and pruning) based on system-discovered dependencies.  So, to alter logic, you just "drop a new rule in the bucket", and the system will ensure it's called in the proper order, and re-used over all the Use Cases to which it applies.

&nbsp;

### b. Extensibile with Python

In this case, we needed to do some if/else testing, and it was convenient to add a pinch of Python. Using "Python as a 4GL" is remarkably simple, even if you are new to Python.

Of course, you have the full object-oriented power of Python and its many libraries, so there are *no automation penalty* restrictions.  

&nbsp;

### c. Debugging: IDE, Logging

The screenshot above illustrates that debugging logic is what you'd expect: use your IDE's debugger.  This "standard-based" approach applies to other development activities, such as source code management, and container-based deployment.

&nbsp;

### d. Customizations Retained

Note we rebuilt the project from our altered database, illustrating we can **iterate, while *preserving customizations.***

&nbsp;

## 4. API Customization: Standard

Of course, we all know that all businesses the world over depend on the `hello world` app.  This is provided in `api/customize_api`.  Observe that it's:

* standard Python

* using Flask

* and, for database access, SQLAlchemy.  Note all updates from custom APIs also enforce your logic.

&nbsp;

## 5. Deploy Containers: Collaborate

API Logic Server also creates scripts for deployment.  While these are ***not required at this demo,*** this means you can enable collaboration with Business Users:

1. Create a container from your project -- see `devops/docker-image/build_image.sh`
2. Upload to Docker Hub, and
3. Deploy for agile collaboration.

&nbsp;

## Summary

<img src="https://github.com/ApiLogicServer/Docs/blob/main/docs/images/basic_demo/summary.jpeg?raw=true">

In minutes - not days or weeks - you've used API Logic Server to convert an idea into **working software,** added **logic and security,** and **iterated** to meet new requirements.

To dive deeper, you can install [API Logic Server](https://apilogicserver.github.io/Docs) and execute this demo - or create a system from your own databases.

## Appendix: Database Schema

<img src="https://github.com/ApiLogicServer/Docs/blob/main/docs/images/basic_demo/basic_demo_data_model.jpeg?raw=true" width="500">

&nbsp;

## Appendix: Procedures

Specific procedures for running the demo are here, so they do not interrupt the conceptual discussion above.

You can use either VSCode or Pycharm.

&nbsp;

**1. Establish your Virtual Environment**

Python employs a virtual environment for project-specific dependencies.  Create one as shown below, depending on your IDE.

For VSCode:

Establish your `venv`, and run it via the first pre-built Run Configuration.  To establish your venv:

```bash
python -m venv venv; venv\Scripts\activate     # win
python3 -m venv venv; . venv/bin/activate      # mac/linux

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For PyCharm, you will get a dialog requesting to create the `venv`; say yes.

See [here](https://apilogicserver.github.io/Docs/Install-Express/) for more information.

&nbsp;

**2. Start and Stop the Server**

Both IDEs provide Run Configurations to start programs.  These are pre-built by `ApiLogicServer create`.

For VSCode, start the Server with F5, Stop with Shift-F5 or the red stop button.

For PyCharm, start the server with CTL-D, Stop with red stop button.

&nbsp;

**3. Entering a new Order**

To enter a new Order:

1. Click `Customer 1``

2. Click `+ ADD NEW ORDER`

3. Set `Notes` to "hurry", and press `SAVE AND SHOW`

4. Click `+ ADD NEW ITEM`

5. Enter Quantity 1, lookup "Product 1", and click `SAVE AND ADD ANOTHER`

6. Enter Quantity 2000, lookup "Product 2", and click `SAVE`

7. Observe the constraint error, triggered by rollups from the `Item` to the `Order` and `Customer`

8. Correct the quantity to 2, and click `Save`


**4. Update the Order**

To explore our new logic for green products:

1. Access the previous order, and `ADD NEW ITEM`

2. Enter quantity 11, lookup product `Green`, and click `Save`.

&nbsp;

## Appendix: Add Database Column

The database here is SQLite.  You can use the SQLite CLI to add a column using the terminal window of your IDE:

```bash
$ sqlite3 database/db.sqlite
>   alter table Products Add CarbonNeutral Boolean;
>   .exit
```

The SQLite DBMS is installed with API Logic Server, but the **CLI** is not provided on all systems.  If it's not installed, [you can install it like this](https://apilogicserver.github.io/Docs/Database-Connectivity/#sqlite).
