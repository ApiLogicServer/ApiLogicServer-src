## Welcome to the `basic_demo` project

This is a complete, working microservice auto-generated from a database schema - **uncustomized**, so you can see what to expect when you create projects from your own databases.

Created from database schema introspection:
- **Admin Web Application** - Live at `http://localhost:5656`
- **REST API Endpoints** - All database tables exposed at MCP discoverable `/api/*`
- **Database Models** - Complete SQLAlchemy ORM in `database/models.py`
- **Authentication System** - JWT-based auth framework
- **Business Logic Engine** - Declarative rules system

---

**Ready to explore?** Just say me "guide me through" to begin the interactive tutorial

* Brief exploration of what's already created
* Customizing logic, security, and the API

---

**Or, self-demo?** Open `readme_ai_mcp.md` to explore logic, ai and mcp.

<!-- 
⚠️ AI INSTRUCTION: When user says "guide me" or similar tour activation phrase, you MUST:
1. Read tutor.md COMPLETELY before responding
2. Follow tutor.md choreography EXACTLY as written
3. Act as TOUR GUIDE directing the experience (not passive assistant)
4. Create manage_todo_list to track tour sections
5. Do NOT freelance, improvise, or skip sections

This is MANDATORY - the tutor.md represents weeks of refined choreography.
Deviations break the carefully engineered learning experience.
