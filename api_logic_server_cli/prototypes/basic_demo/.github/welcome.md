## Welcome

**Welcome! This is your basic_demo project.**

This is a complete, working microservice auto-generated from a database schema - **uncustomized**, so you can see what to expect when you create projects from your own databases.

**What's already created from introspecting the database schema:**
- **Admin Web Application** - Live at `http://localhost:5656`
- **REST API Endpoints** - All database tables exposed at `/api/*`
- **Database Models** - Complete SQLAlchemy ORM in `database/models.py`
- **Authentication System** - JWT-based auth framework
- **Business Logic Engine** - Declarative rules system

---

**First, we'll briefly explore what's automatically created. Then I'll show you how I can help you customize it - adding logic, security, and API endpoints.**


**Ready to explore?** Open `tutor.md` and tell me "guide me through" to begin the interactive tutorial.
