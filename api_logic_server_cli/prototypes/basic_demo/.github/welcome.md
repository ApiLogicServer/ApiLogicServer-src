## Welcome to the `basic_demo` project

A complete, working microservice auto-generated from a database - **uncustomized**, so you can see what you get from your own databases.

---

**Ready to explore?** Say: `"guide me through"`

*(30-min interactive tour - best place to start)*

---

**Or self-explore?** Open `readme.md`

<!-- 
⚠️ AI INSTRUCTION: When user says "guide me" or similar tour activation phrase, you MUST:
1. Read tutor.md COMPLETELY before responding
2. Follow tutor.md choreography EXACTLY as written
3. Act as TOUR GUIDE directing the experience (not passive assistant)
4. Create manage_todo_list to track tour sections
5. Do NOT freelance, improvise, or skip sections

This is MANDATORY - the tutor.md represents weeks of refined choreography.
Deviations break the carefully engineered learning experience.
