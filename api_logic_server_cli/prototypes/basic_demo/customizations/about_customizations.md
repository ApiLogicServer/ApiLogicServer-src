## Normal Customizations

API and Admin creation is fully automated by the `ApiLogicServer create` CLI command.  

You then customize your logic and security by editing `logic/declare_logic.py` and `security/declare_security.py` in your IDE.  These files are created as stubs by `ApiLogicServer create`.

## Customization for this demo

These files in this directory demonstrate such logic and security customizations. As described in the readme, you will copy these over the created stubs in the `logic` and `security` directories.
