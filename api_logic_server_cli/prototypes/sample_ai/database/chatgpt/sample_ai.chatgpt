Create a sqlite database for customers, orders, items and product

Hints: use autonum keys, allow nulls, Decimal types, foreign keys, no check constraints.

Include a notes field for orders.

Create a few rows of only customer and product data.

Enforce the Check Credit requirement (do not generate check constraints):

1. Customer.Balance <= CreditLimit
2. Customer.Balance = Sum(Order.AmountTotal where date shipped is null)
3. Order.AmountTotal = Sum(Items.Amount)
4. Items.Amount = Quantity * UnitPrice
5. Store the Items.UnitPrice as a copy from Product.UnitPrice
