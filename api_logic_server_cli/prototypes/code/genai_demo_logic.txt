Use Logic Bank to enforce the Check Credit requirement (do not generate check constraints):
1. The customer's balance must not exceed the credit limit.
2. The customer's balance is the sum of all unshipped orders.
3. The order amount total is the sum of all item amounts.
4. The item amount is the quantity times the unit price.
5. The unit price is copied from the product.

Enforce the Check Credit requirement (do not generate check constraints):
1. Customer.Balance <= CreditLimit
2. Customer.Balance = Sum(Order.AmountTotal where date shipped is null)
3. Order.AmountTotal = Sum(Items.Amount)
4. Items.Amount = Quantity * UnitPrice
5. Store the Items.UnitPrice as a copy from Product.UnitPrice
