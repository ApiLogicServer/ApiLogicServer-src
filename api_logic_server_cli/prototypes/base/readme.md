# 1. Setup and Run

To run your project, the system requires various runtime systems for data access, api, and logic.  These are included with API Logic Server ([architecture doc here](https://apilogicserver.github.io/Docs/Architecture-What-Is/)).  So, to run your project ([instructions here](#setup-instructions)):

1.  __Establish your Python Environment__ to activate these runtime systems
2. __Run__

Setup your Python environment, according to whether you did a *local install*, or *Docker*.  Choose the appropriate section, then run.

&nbsp;

## Establish Your Python Environment - Local Install

You `requirements.txt` has already been created, so...

```bash title="Install API Logic Server in a Virtual Environment"
python -m venv venv                        # may require python3 -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate                      # mac/linux: source venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt  # accept "new Virtual environment"
```

Notes:

* See also the `venv_setup` directory in this API Logic Project.

* If using SqlServer, install `pyodbc`.  Not required for docker-based projects.  For local installs, see the [Quick Start](https://apilogicserver.github.io/Docs/Install-pyodbc/).

* If you are creating multiple projects, you may wish to use a [Shared venv](https://apilogicserver.github.io/Docs/Project-Env/).

&nbsp;

## Establish Your Python Environment - Docker

Your runtime systems are part of Dev Container, which you probably activated when you [opened the project](https://apilogicserver.github.io/Docs/IDE-Execute/).  
 * If you did not accept the "Open in Container" option when you started VSCode, use __View > Command Palette > Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container__.

&nbsp;

## Run

To run your project

![Start Project](https://github.com/ApiLogicServer/Docs/blob/main/docs/images/tutorial/2-apilogicproject-nutshell.png?raw=true)

As shown above:

1. Use the pre-supplied Run Configuration; use either:
    * `**ApiLogicServer - No Security (e.g., for behave tests** to run *with security* (recommended initially)
    * `**ApiLogicServer** to run [with security](https://apilogicserver.github.io/Docs/Security-Swagger/)
2. Click the url in the console to start the Admin App
    * Use it to explore your data (shown below)
    * And your API (via Swagger)

![Admin App](https://github.com/ApiLogicServer/Docs/blob/main/docs/images/ui-admin/run-admin-app.png?raw=true)

&nbsp;

# 2. Deployment

The `devops` directory contains several scripts for creating container images, testing them, and deploying them.

Since API Logic Server creates working software (UI, API), you can do this after creating your project, to [collaborate with your team](https://apilogicserver.github.io/Docs/DevOps-Containers-Preview/).

&nbsp;

# 3. Key Customization Files

Your project is ready to run, but it's likely you'll want to customize it - declare logic, new endpoints, etc.

The ___Key Customization Files___ listed in the table below are created as stubs, intended for you to add customizations that extend
the created API, Logic and Web App.

* Since they are separate files, the project can be
[rebuilt](https://apilogicserver.github.io/Docs/Project-Rebuild/) (e.g., synchronized with a revised schema), preserving your customizations.

Please see the `nw` sample for examples of typical customizations.  You can open it in GitHub (use Shift + "." to view in project mode) - [click here](https://github.com/ApiLogicServer/demo).

# 4. Project Requirements

Optionally, you can **document requirements** as part of an **executable test plan**.  Test plan execution creates documentation (in markdown), including **requirements traceability** into implementation.  [See example here](test/api_logic_server_behave/reports/Behave%20Logic%20Report%20Sample.md).

&nbsp;

# 5. Project Information

This API Logic Project was created with the `ApiLogicServer create` command.

# Appendix: Key Technologies

API Logic Server is based on the projects shown below.
Consult their documentation for important information.

&nbsp;

### SARFS JSON:API Server

[SAFRS: Python OpenAPI & JSON:API Framework](https://github.com/thomaxxl/safrs)

SAFRS is an acronym for SqlAlchemy Flask-Restful Swagger.
The purpose of this framework is to help python developers create
a self-documenting JSON API for sqlalchemy database objects and relationships.

These objects are serialized to JSON and 
created, retrieved, updated and deleted through the JSON API.
Optionally, custom resource object methods can be exposed and invoked using JSON.

Class and method descriptions and examples can be provided
in yaml syntax in the code comments.

The description is parsed and shown in the swagger web interface.
The result is an easy-to-use
swagger/OpenAPI and JSON:API compliant API implementation.

&nbsp;

### LogicBank
[Transaction Logic for SQLAlchemy Object Models](https://apilogicserver.github.io/Docs/Logic-Why/)

Use Logic Bank to govern SQLAlchemy update transaction logic - 
multi-table derivations, constraints, and actions such as sending mail or messages. Logic consists of _both:_

*   **Rules - 40X** more concise using a spreadsheet-like paradigm, and

*   **Python - control and extensibility,** using standard tools and techniques

Logic Bank is based on SQLAlchemy - it handles `before_flush` events to enforce your logic.
Your logic therefore applies to any SQLAlchemy-based access - JSON:Api, Admin App, etc.

&nbsp;

### SQLAlchemy

[Object Relational Mapping for Python](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/).

SQLAlchemy provides Python-friendly database access for Python.

It is used by JSON:Api, Logic Bank, and the Admin App.

SQLAlchemy processing is based on Python `model` classes,
created automatically by API Logic Server from your database,
and saved in the `database` directory.

&nbsp;

### Admin App

This generated project also contains a React Admin app:
* Multi-page - including page transitions to "drill down"
* Multi-table - master / details (with tab sheets)
* Intelligent layout - favorite fields first, predictive joins, etc
* Logic Aware - updates are monitored by business logic
