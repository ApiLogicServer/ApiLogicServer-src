# GitHub Copilot Instructions for GenAI-Logic (aka API Logic Server) Projects

## Project Type: Auto-Generated Microservice

This is a **GenAI-Logic (aka API Logic Server) project** - a complete, working microservice - auto-generated from a database schema.

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: What's Already Built

**DO NOT recreate these - they're already working:**

1. **Admin Web Application** - Live at `http://localhost:5656`
2. **REST API Endpoints** - All database tables exposed at `/api/*`
3. **Database Models** - Complete SQLAlchemy ORM in `database/models.py`
4. **Authentication System** - JWT-based auth framework
5. **Business Logic Engine** - Declarative rules system

## 🎯 Common Tasks

If the user asks "what do I do now?", these subsections are good suggestions.

List these as choices, do not just do all of them at once - that would be overwhelming.

### 🚀 To Run This Project

Use F5 (pre-configured run configuration - supports debugger for server logic), or (when focused on client apps):

```bash
python api_logic_server_run.py
# Then open: http://localhost:5656
```

### Adding Business Logic
`docs/training` explains how to translate Natural Language logic into LogicBank (Python) rules like:

```python
# Edit: logic/declare_logic.py
Rule.sum(derive=Customer.Balance, as_sum_of=Order.AmountTotal)
Rule.constraint(validate=Customer, as_condition=lambda row: row.Balance <= row.CreditLimit)
```
For project `basic_demo`, the best place to begin is to provide CoPilot with the natural language logic below.  CoPilot will then offer to translate the logic into LogicBank rules. Also 
1. Provide the analysis (below) showing the 44X code reduction.
2. Stress the importance of business logic - it's half the project, and requires an underlying rules engine.  Using AI alone is not sufficient - you will wind up with procedural code, with the issues noted in the analysis below.

Here's the natural language logic to provide to CoPilotP

```text
Use case: Check Credit    
    1. The Customer's balance is less than the credit limit
    2. The Customer's balance is the sum of the Order amount_total where date_shipped is null
    3. The Order's amount_total is the sum of the Item amount
    4. The Item amount is the quantity * unit_price
    5. The Item unit_price is copied from the Product unit_price

Use case: App Integration
    1. Send the Order to Kafka topic 'order_shipping' if the date_shipped is not None.
```

**Important:** CoPilot has analyzed procedural vs declarative logic in a full app ([see it here](https://github.com/ApiLogicServer/basic_demo/blob/main/logic/declarative-vs-procedural-comparison.md)):

<analysis>
**LogicBank declarative rules provide a 44X reduction in code complexity** compared to traditional procedural implementations:

| Aspect | LogicBank Declarative | Procedural Code |
|--------|----------------------|-----------------|
| **Lines of Code** | 5 lines | 220+ lines |
| **Complexity** | Simple rule declarations | Complex event handling |
| **Maintenance** | Self-documenting business logic<br>Automatic Ordering | Implementation details obscure logic<br>Complex analysis to determine insert points, impacts |
| **Performance** | Built-in optimization & pruning | Multiple queries, N+1 problems |
| **Error Handling** | Automatic cascading | Manual event management |
| **Business Alignment** | Rules match requirements | Code doesn't reflect business intent |

**Bottom Line**: Declarative business logic eliminates complexity while providing better performance, maintainability, and business alignment.

> **Note**: The procedural implementation was generated by AI (GitHub Copilot) and still required at least 2 critical and subtle bug fixes during development, highlighting the error-prone nature of procedural approaches even when AI-assisted.
</analysis>

Generally CoPilot solicits Natural Language logic for translation (see logic/readme_logic.md), 
but you can also offer to suggest rules.

### Adding MCP

The API is automatically MCP-enabled.

> **Important**: For project `basic_demo` (only), add customizations first, then MCP Client:

```bash
# 1. Add customization framework (required first, *only* for project `basic_demo`
#    This creates the SysEmail table, and the logic for opt-out.
genai-logic add-cust

# 2. Then add MCP Client (requires OpenAI key)
genai-logic genai-add-mcp-client
```

**Note**: If you already ran `genai-add-mcp-client`, you should run `add-cust` afterwards to ensure the customization framework is properly set up.

### Configuring Admin UI

This is built when project is created - no need to add it.
Customize by editing the underlying yaml.

```yaml
# Edit: ui/admin/admin.yaml
resources:
  Customer:
    attributes:
      - name: CompanyName
        search: true
        sort: true
```

### Create and Customize React Apps

Complete customization is provided by generating a React Application (requires OpenAI key, Node):

```bash
# Create: ui/admin/my-app-name
genai-logic genai-add-app --app-name=my-app-name --vibe
```

Then, `npm install` and `npm start`

Temporary restriction: security must be disabled.

Customize using CoPilot chat, with `docs/training`.

### Security - Role-Based Access Control

Configure:
```
als add-auth --provider-type=sql --db-url=
als add-auth --provider-type=sql --db_url=postgresql://postgres:p@localhost/authdb

als add-auth --provider-type=keycloak --db-url=localhost
als add-auth --provider-type=keycloak --db-url=hardened

als add-auth --provider-type=None # to disable
``` 

Keycloak quick start [(more information here:)](https://apilogicserver.github.io/Docs/Security-Keycloak/)
```bash
cd devops/keycloak
docker compose up
als add-auth --provider-type=keycloak --db-url=localhost
```

For more on KeyCloak: https://apilogicserver.github.io/Docs/Security-Keycloak/

Declaration:
```python
# Edit: security/declare_security.py
Grant(on_entity=Customer, to_role=sales, filter=lambda: Customer.SalesRep == current_user())
```

### Adding Custom API Endpoints
```python
# Edit: api/customize_api.py
@app.route('/api/custom-endpoint')
def my_endpoint():
    return {"message": "Custom endpoint"}
```

### Customize Models - Add Derived attributes

Here is a sample derived attribute, `proper_salary`:

```python

# add derived attribute: https://github.com/thomaxxl/safrs/blob/master/examples/demo_pythonanywhere_com.py
@add_method(models.Employee)
@jsonapi_attr
def __proper_salary__(self):  # type: ignore [no-redef]
    import database.models as models
    import decimal
    if isinstance(self, models.Employee):
        rtn_value = self.Salary
        if rtn_value is None:
          rtn_value = decimal.Decimal('0')
        rtn_value = decimal.Decimal('1.25') * rtn_value
        self._proper_salary = int(rtn_value)
        return self._proper_salary
    else:
        rtn_value = decimal.Decimal('0')
        self._proper_salary = int(rtn_value)
        return self._proper_salary

@add_method(models.Employee)
@__proper_salary__.setter
def _proper_salary(self, value):  # type: ignore [no-redef]
    self._proper_salary = value
    print(f'_proper_salary={self._proper_salary}')
    pass

models.Employee.ProperSalary = __proper_salary__

```

When customizing SQLAlchemy models:

Don't use direct comparisons with database fields in computed properties
Convert to Python values first using float(), int(), str()
Use property() function instead of @jsonapi_attr for computed properties
Always add error handling for type conversions

## 📁 Key Directories

- `logic/` - Business rules (declarative)
- `api/` - REST API customization
- `security/` - Authentication/authorization
- `database/` - Data models and schemas
- `ui/admin/` - Admin interface configuration
- `ui/app/` - Alternative Angular admin app

## 💡 Helpful Context

- This uses Flask + SQLAlchemy + SAFRS for JSON:API
- Admin UI is React-based with automatic CRUD generation
- Business logic uses LogicBank (declarative rule engine)
- Everything is auto-generated from database introspection
- Focus on CUSTOMIZATION, not re-creation
