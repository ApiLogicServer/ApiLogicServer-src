This folder is to simplify recreating the nw project on PythonAnywhere:

1. Rebuild the dev/venv folder as necessary, and create the project:

        https://apilogicserver.github.io/Docs/Install/

        cd dev
        rm -r venv
        python3 -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate
        python3 -m pip install ApiLogicServer

        ApiLogicServer create --host=ApiLogicServer.pythonanywhere.com --port=

        curl -X 'GET' \
  'http://ApiLogicServer.pythonanywhere.com/api/Employee/?include=EmployeeAuditList%2CEmployeeTerritoryList%2COrderList%2CDepartment%2CDepartment1%2CUnion&fields%5BEmployee%5D=Id%2CLastName%2CFirstName%2CTitle%2CTitleOfCourtesy%2CBirthDate%2CHireDate%2CAddress%2CCity%2CRegion%2CPostalCode%2CCountry%2CHomePhone%2CExtension%2CPhoto%2CNotes%2CReportsTo%2CPhotoPath%2CEmployeeType%2CSalary%2CWorksForDepartmentId%2COnLoanDepartmentId%2CUnionId%2CDues&page%5Boffset%5D=0&page%5Blimit%5D=10&sort=id' \
  -H 'accept: application/vnd.api+json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json'



3. Update the project files from this directory


Note: yaml is from admin_custom_nw.yaml, but
    api_root: https://apilogicserver.pythonanywhere.com/api
        MEM loader fails - replace with from-file!!
    HomeJS: https://apilogicserver.pythonanywhere.com/admin-app/homeZZ.js  # force use of ValH.js
