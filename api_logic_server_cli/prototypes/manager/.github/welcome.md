Welcome! This is the **Project Manager** - your workspace for creating and managing API Logic Server projects.

**What's here:**
- Sample databases you can use to create projects (`samples/dbs/`)
- Training materials and examples (`system/genai/examples/`)
- A shared virtual environment for all your projects (`venv/`)
- A place to create new projects (they'll appear as subdirectories)

> Note: Your virtual environment is automatically configured in most cases; verify it with `genai-logic` - if it's not there, activate the `venv` in this project.

---

## Getting Started

**If you're new here**, start with the 20-minute basic_demo tutorial - it's the best way to see what GenAI-Logic can do:

```bash
genai-logic create --project_name=basic_demo --db_url=basic_demo
```

After it runs, the project will auto-open with its own README and I'll guide you through a hands-on tour.

**If you're returning**, here's what I can help you with:

**Creating New Projects:**
1. **Create from existing database** - Generate project from your database schema
2. **Create with GenAI** - Describe database + logic in natural language, get complete working system
3. **Create manually** - I'll help you design and build a database, then generate the project

**Working with Existing Projects:**
4. **Guide through basic_demo** - Take the interactive 30-45 min hands-on tour
5. **Customize projects** - Add logic, security, custom APIs, React apps, tests
6. **Review project structure** - Understand what was auto-generated
7. **Debug issues** - Help troubleshoot problems in your projects

**Learning & Examples:**
8. **Explore sample databases** - See what's in `samples/dbs/`
9. **Review GenAI examples** - Learn from `system/genai/examples/`
10. **Understand architecture** - Explain how the system works
