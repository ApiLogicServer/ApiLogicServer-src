# GitHub Copilot Instructions for GenAI-Logic (aka API Logic Server) - Project Manager

⚠️ **IMPORTANT FOR AI ASSISTANTS**: Always read and follow these instructions when helping with this project.

## What is the Project Manager?

Welcome! This is the **Project Manager** - think of it as your workspace for creating and managing API Logic Server projects.

**What's here:**
- Sample databases you can use to create projects (`samples/dbs/`)
- Training materials and examples (`system/genai/examples/`)
- A shared virtual environment for all your projects (`venv/`)
- A place to create new projects (they'll appear as subdirectories)

**What you'll do here:**
Create projects from databases - each project becomes a complete, working microservice with API, Admin UI, and business logic support. Once created, you'll work inside that project to customize and extend it.

> Note: Your virtual environment is automatically configured in most cases; verify it with `genai-logic` - if it's not there, activate the `venv` in this project.

## Quick Start

**First time here?** Let's start with the 20-minute basic_demo tutorial - it's the best way to see what GenAI-Logic can do.

Run this command:

```bash
genai-logic create --project_name=basic_demo --db_url=basic_demo
```

After it runs, the project will auto-open with its own README and I'll guide you through a hands-on tour.

**Already have basic_demo?** Open it and say "Guide me through basic_demo" for the hands-on tour, or ask me what else we can work on.

## Creating Projects

There are multiple ways to create projects (aka systems, microservices) - see the subsections below.

**KEY DISTINCTION:**
- `genai-logic create` - Creates infrastructure only (API, UI, models) - **NO business logic rules**
- `genai-logic genai` - Creates complete system including **business logic rules from natural language**

### Method 1: Create Projects from an existing database (Infrastructure Only)

If you have a database reference, I can create a project from it. (Sample databases are in `samples/dbs`). 

```bash
genai-logic create  --project_name=nw --db_url=sqlite:///samples/dbs/nw.sqlite
```

**Important:** This creates the project structure, API, Admin App, and database models, but **NO business logic rules**.

**To add logic:** We can add rules together using natural language in `logic/declare_logic.py`, or you can code them manually with IDE autocomplete.

### Method 2: Create Projects with GenAI (Complete System with Logic)

**Use this when you have both database AND business logic requirements.**

Describe database and logic in Natural Language in a prompt file.

See samples at `system/genai/examples`.  For example:

```bash
genai-logic genai --using=system/genai/examples/genai_demo/genai_demo.prompt --project-name=genai_demo
```

**This approach:**
1. Creates the database from description
2. Generates SQLAlchemy models
3. **Automatically generates business logic rules** from the requirements in the prompt
4. Creates test data
5. Creates API, Admin App, and complete project structure

**When to use:** When you have requirements like "Customer balance is sum of orders" or "Check credit limit" - the LLM will generate the corresponding `Rule.sum`, `Rule.constraint`, etc.

### Method 3: Create Projects with new databases (Manual Approach)

If you provide a description but want to create the database manually:

1. I'll create a sqlite database from your description. I'll be sure to include foreign keys. The system works well with `id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT`.
2. Then, I'll use the `genai-logic create` command above.
3. If you have logic requirements, we can translate them together using `system/genai/learning_requests/logic_bank_api.prompt`.

## Working Together

When you ask "what should I do now?" or similar:

1. **I'll recommend starting with basic_demo** using the command above
2. **I'll use CLI commands** (genai-logic) not Docker scripts for project creation
3. **I'll point you to sample databases** in `samples/dbs/` for examples
4. **I'll show you GenAI examples** in `system/genai/examples/` for AI-generated projects
5. **We'll follow the 20-minute workflow** described in the main README

## Available Databases
- `basic_demo` - Best for first-time users
- `nw.sqlite` - Northwind sample
- `chinook.sqlite` - Music store sample  
- `classicmodels.sqlite` - Classic car models sample
