# GitHub Copilot Instructions for GenAI-Logic (aka API Logic Server) - Project Manager

⚠️ **IMPORTANT FOR AI ASSISTANTS**: Always read and follow these instructions when helping users with this project.

The Project Manager contains genai training, a virtual environment, and provides a convenient place to create projects.

> Note: your virtual environment is automatically configured in most cases; verify it with `genai-logic` - it it's not there, activate the `venv` in this project.

## Quick Start for New Users

**ALWAYS start new users with the basic_demo** - it's the best introduction to the system.

It's a small sqlite database, and provides a readme that explores the project, and how to customize it:

```bash
genai-logic create --project_name=basic_demo --db_url=basic_demo
```

## Creating Projects

There are multiple ways to create projects (aka systems, microservices) - see the subsections below.

**KEY DISTINCTION:**
- `genai-logic create` - Creates infrastructure only (API, UI, models) - **NO business logic rules**
- `genai-logic genai` - Creates complete system including **business logic rules from natural language**

### Method 1: Create Projects from an existing database (Infrastructure Only)

If the user provides a database reference, use the command below.  (Note: sqlite sample databases at `samples/dbs`). 

```bash
genai-logic create  --project_name=nw --db_url=sqlite:///samples/dbs/nw.sqlite
```

**Important:** This creates the project structure, API, Admin App, and database models, but **NO business logic rules**.

**To add logic:** Users must add rules separately using:
- Natural language with Copilot/AI assistant in `logic/declare_logic.py`, or
- Manual coding with IDE code completion

### Method 2: Create Projects with GenAI (Complete System with Logic)

**Use this when the user provides both database AND business logic requirements.**

Describe database and logic in Natural Language in a prompt file.

See samples at `system/genai/examples`.  For example:

```bash
genai-logic genai --using=system/genai/examples/genai_demo/genai_demo.prompt --project-name=genai_demo
```

**This approach:**
1. Creates the database from description
2. Generates SQLAlchemy models
3. **Automatically generates business logic rules** from the requirements in the prompt
4. Creates test data
5. Creates API, Admin App, and complete project structure

**When to use:** User provides requirements like "Customer balance is sum of orders" or "Check credit limit" - the LLM will generate the corresponding `Rule.sum`, `Rule.constraint`, etc.

### Method 3: Create Projects with new databases (Manual Approach)

If the user provides a description but you want to create the database manually:

1. Create a sqlite database from the description.  Be sure to include foreign keys.  The system works well with `id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT`.
2. Then, use the `genai-logic create` command above.
3. If logic is provided, translate it using Copilot or `system/genai/learning_requests/logic_bank_api.prompt`.

## AI Assistant Guidelines

When users ask "what do I do now?" or similar questions:

1. **Always recommend starting with basic_demo** using the command above
2. **Use CLI commands** (genai-logic) not Docker scripts for project creation
3. **Refer to existing sample databases** in `samples/dbs/` for examples
4. **Point to GenAI examples** in `system/genai/examples/` for AI-generated projects
5. **Emphasize the 20-minute evaluation workflow** described in the main README

## Available Databases
- `basic_demo` - Best for first-time users
- `nw.sqlite` - Northwind sample
- `chinook.sqlite` - Music store sample  
- `classicmodels.sqlite` - Classic car models sample
