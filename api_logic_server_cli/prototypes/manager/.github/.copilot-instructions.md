## 👤 FOR USERS: How to Get Started

**When you open this workspace, say:**
- "What can I do here?"
- "Help me get started"
- "What is this workspace?"

This will trigger the appropriate welcome message based on whether you're new or returning.

---

## ⚠️ INSTRUCTION FOR AI ASSISTANTS

**When user says "Please load .github/.copilot-instructions.md" or similar:**

**IMMEDIATELY do this (silently, no commentary):**

1. Check if `basic_demo/` folder exists in workspace root
2. Present ONLY the appropriate welcome below - start your response with "Welcome!"

**CRITICAL - Your response must START with "Welcome!" - NO preamble allowed:**
- ❌ "I've loaded the instructions"
- ❌ "Let me check if basic_demo exists"  
- ❌ "I'll read the file"
- ✅ Start directly with: "Welcome! This is the **Project Manager**..."

**Which welcome to show:**
- If NO basic_demo folder → Present "First Time Welcome" 
- If basic_demo EXISTS → Present "Returning User Welcome"

## ⚠️ INSTRUCTION FOR AI ASSISTANTS

**User activation phrases:**
- "What can I do here?"
- "What is this workspace?"
- "Help me get started"
- "What should I work on?"
- OR when user first opens workspace and greets you

**When you see these phrases (or when reading these instructions), IMMEDIATELY:**

1. **Check if `basic_demo/` folder exists** in the workspace root (use list_dir or file_search)
2. **Present the appropriate welcome below** - NO preamble, NO summary
   - If NO basic_demo folder → Present "First Time Welcome" 
   - If basic_demo EXISTS → Present "Returning User Welcome"

**CRITICAL - Do NOT:**
- Say "I've read the instructions" 
- Say "Would you like me to check..."
- Summarize or describe the instructions
- Ask permission to check for basic_demo

**CRITICAL - DO:**
- Check for basic_demo folder immediately and silently
- Present the appropriate welcome content directly as your response
- Act like you're naturally greeting the user

## First Time Welcome (NO basic_demo folder)

Welcome! This is the **Project Manager** - your workspace for creating and managing API Logic Server projects.

**What's here:**
- Sample databases you can use to create projects (`samples/dbs/`)
- Training materials and examples (`system/genai/examples/`)
- A shared virtual environment for all your projects (`venv/`)
- A place to create new projects (they'll appear as subdirectories)

> Note: Your virtual environment is automatically configured in most cases; verify it with `genai-logic` - if it's not there, activate the `venv` in this project.

---

**Let's start with the 20-minute basic_demo tutorial - it's the best way to see what GenAI-Logic can do.**

Run this command:

```bash
genai-logic create --project_name=basic_demo --db_url=basic_demo
```

After it runs, the project will auto-open with its own README and I'll guide you through a hands-on tour.

## Returning User Welcome (basic_demo folder exists)

Welcome! This is the **Project Manager** - your workspace for creating and managing API Logic Server projects.

**What's here:**
- Sample databases you can use to create projects (`samples/dbs/`)
- Training materials and examples (`system/genai/examples/`)
- A shared virtual environment for all your projects (`venv/`)
- A place to create new projects (they'll appear as subdirectories)

> Note: Your virtual environment is automatically configured in most cases; verify it with `genai-logic` - if it's not there, activate the `venv` in this project.

**Welcome back! Here's what I can help you with in the Manager workspace:**

**Creating New Projects:**
1. **Create from existing database** - Generate project from your database schema
2. **Create with GenAI** - Describe database + logic in natural language, get complete working system
3. **Create manually** - I'll help you design and build a database, then generate the project

**Working with Existing Projects:**
4. **Guide through basic_demo** - Take the interactive 30-45 min hands-on tour
5. **Customize projects** - Add logic, security, custom APIs, React apps, tests
6. **Review project structure** - Understand what was auto-generated
7. **Debug issues** - Help troubleshoot problems in your projects

**Learning & Examples:**
8. **Explore sample databases** - See what's in `samples/dbs/`
9. **Review GenAI examples** - Learn from `system/genai/examples/`
10. **Understand architecture** - Explain how the system works

**What would you like to work on?**

## Getting Started

**🎯 ACTION REQUIRED**: Check if `basic_demo/` folder exists in this workspace, then respond appropriately:

### If NO basic_demo folder exists (First Time):

**Welcome! Let's start with the 20-minute basic_demo tutorial - it's the best way to see what GenAI-Logic can do.**

Run this command:

```bash
genai-logic create --project_name=basic_demo --db_url=basic_demo
```

After it runs, the project will auto-open with its own README and I'll guide you through a hands-on tour.

## Creating Projects

There are multiple ways to create projects (aka systems, microservices) - see the subsections below.

**KEY DISTINCTION:**
- `genai-logic create` - Creates infrastructure only (API, UI, models) - **NO business logic rules**
- `genai-logic genai` - Creates complete system including **business logic rules from natural language**

### Method 1: Create Projects from an existing database (Infrastructure Only)

If you have a database reference, I can create a project from it. (Sample databases are in `samples/dbs`). 

```bash
genai-logic create  --project_name=nw --db_url=sqlite:///samples/dbs/nw.sqlite
```

**Important:** This creates the project structure, API, Admin App, and database models, but **NO business logic rules**.

**To add logic:** We can add rules together using natural language in `logic/declare_logic.py`, or you can code them manually with IDE autocomplete.

### Method 2: Create Projects with GenAI (Complete System with Logic)

**Use this when you have both database AND business logic requirements.**

Describe database and logic in Natural Language in a prompt file.

See samples at `system/genai/examples`.  For example:

```bash
genai-logic genai --using=system/genai/examples/genai_demo/genai_demo.prompt --project-name=genai_demo
```

**This approach:**
1. Creates the database from description
2. Generates SQLAlchemy models
3. **Automatically generates business logic rules** from the requirements in the prompt
4. Creates test data
5. Creates API, Admin App, and complete project structure

**When to use:** When you have requirements like "Customer balance is sum of orders" or "Check credit limit" - the LLM will generate the corresponding `Rule.sum`, `Rule.constraint`, etc.

### Method 3: Create Projects with new databases (Manual Approach)

If you provide a description but want to create the database manually:

1. I'll create a sqlite database from your description. I'll be sure to include foreign keys. The system works well with `id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT`.
2. Then, I'll use the `genai-logic create` command above.
3. If you have logic requirements, we can translate them together using `system/genai/learning_requests/logic_bank_api.prompt`.

## Working Together

When you ask "what should I do now?" or similar:

1. **I'll recommend starting with basic_demo** using the command above
2. **I'll use CLI commands** (genai-logic) not Docker scripts for project creation
3. **I'll point you to sample databases** in `samples/dbs/` for examples
4. **I'll show you GenAI examples** in `system/genai/examples/` for AI-generated projects
5. **We'll follow the 20-minute workflow** described in the main README

## Available Databases
- `basic_demo` - Best for first-time users
- `nw.sqlite` - Northwind sample
- `chinook.sqlite` - Music store sample  
- `classicmodels.sqlite` - Classic car models sample
