# AI Test Context Configuration
# This file provides INPUT conditions for AI testing (world_conditions)
# AI still makes the decision - we just provide the scenario context

# World conditions for AI supplier selection
# world_conditions: 'normal conditions'

# Example alternate scenarios (uncomment to test):
world_conditions: 'Suez Canal blocked - use alternate shipping routes'
# world_conditions: 'pandemic supply chain disruptions - prioritize reliability'
# world_conditions: 'economic recession - minimize costs'
