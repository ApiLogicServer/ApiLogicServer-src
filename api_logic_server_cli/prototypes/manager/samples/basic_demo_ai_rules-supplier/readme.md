**Key Takeways - TL;DR - AI Rules: governed judgment calls inside deterministic logic**
&nbsp;

    Created by: › genai-logic create --project_name=demo_ai_rules_supplier --db_url=sqlite:///samples/dbs/basic_demo.sqlite

    * An AI Rule (Request Pattern) picks the optimal Product Supplier, based on cost, lead time, and world conditions
    * The AI's "proposal" is still governed by the deterministic rules around it — it can't violate business policy
    * Full audit trail of every AI request and response

    Status: Reference implementation

**TL;DR - Integrated Deterministic and AI Rules**
&nbsp;
##
AI provides creativity and reasoning that businesses want... how do we provide that, *with deterministic goverance?*.  

For example - a business can continue to operate even if a tanker has blocked the Suez canal by choosing an alternate supplier, as declared in the prompt shown below (rule 6).

This sample illustrates:

1. Using **AI Rules** to pick the optimal supplier (calls AI at runtime, with auditing shown above)
2. Other rules provide Governance - whether AI rules, or calling client (e.g., check credit)

## Declare and Test

If you have not already created the sample project, you can create it in the Manager using Copilot:

&emsp;*Create a system named basic_demo from samples/dbs/basic_demo.sqlite*.  

Then:


&nbsp;
**Paste this logic into Copilot chat (note: takes several minutes)**
&nbsp;

    On Placing Orders, Requirement Check Credit:

    1. The Customer's balance is less than the credit limit
    2. The Customer's balance is the sum of the Order amount_total where date_shipped is null
    3. The Order's amount_total is the sum of the Item amount
    4. The Item amount is the quantity * unit_price
    5. The Product count suppliers is the sum of the Product Suppliers
    6. Use AI to Set Item field unit_price by finding the optimal Product Supplier based on cost, lead time, and world conditions

    Requirement: App Integration

    1. Publish the Order to Kafka topic 'order_shipping' if the date_shipped is not None

Developers review this DSL before execution, providing a natural human-in-the-loop checkpoint.

To test:

1. Update config/ai_test_context.yaml to signify Suez Canal blocked
2. Start the Server
3. Order some Egyptian Cotton Sheets (use in the Admin App, or test MCP using Copilot - paste:<br> &emsp;*On Alice's first order, include 100 Egyptian Cotton Sheets*
4. Verify the AI call - use the Admin App to view the audit trail (top of this page)

## Logic Governance Architecture

1. **Context Engineering** directs AI to generate Data Rules — not procedural code. Without it, AI pattern-matches to FrankenCode. With it, intent becomes declarations.

2. **Data Rules** distill path-dependent logic into *path-independent rules on data*. See them below — `Rule.constraint`, `Rule.sum`. No missed paths. Every path inherits them automatically.

3. The **Commit Listener** hooks into the ORM commit. Every transaction — API, agent, workflow — passes through one control point. Nothing bypasses it.

4. The **Rule Engine** computes dependency order from the Data Rules at startup — deterministically. No pattern-matching, no subtle ordering bugs.

## Background Concepts

### Unified Deterministic / Probablilistic Logic

Agentic systems are evolving quickly, and a clearer architectural picture is forming:

> Not AI *vs* Rules — **AI and Rules together.**

Different kinds of logic naturally call for different tools, as in this unified example:

* **Deterministic Logic** — logic that must always be correct, consistent, and governed.  
*Example:* “Customer balance must not exceed credit limit.”

* **AI Logic** — logic that benefits from exploration, adaptation, and probabilistic reasoning.  
*Example:* “Which supplier can still deliver if shipping lanes are disrupted?”

    * **Creative reasoning needs boundaries.<br>Deterministic rules supply the guardrails that keep outcomes correct, consistent, and governed.**

<br>

### Logic Architecture

GenAI-Logic provides support for *AI Rules:*

- At declaration time (e.g., in VSCode/Copilot):

    * **D1:** Accepts a unified declarative NL request
    * **D2.** Uses GenAI to create
        * Rules (in Python DSL: Domain Specific Logic) for deterministic Logic
        * LLM calls for Probablistic

- At runtime, during commit

    * **R1:** DSL is executed by the Rules Engine (deterministic - no NL processing occurs)
    * **R2:** LLM calls are made to compute values (e.g., optimal supplier)
    * The rules engine ensures that R2 logic results are governed by R1 rules

![Bus-Logic-Engine](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ApiLogicServer/Docs/main/docs/images/integration/mcp/Bus-Logic-Agent.png)

**AI logic become far more compelling when probabilistic intent is paired with deterministic enforcement.**

This "governable intent" model aligns with enterprise expectations —  
adaptive where helpful, reliable where essential.

**GenAI-Logic unifies probabilistic intent with deterministic enforcement in a single model**

<br>

## AI Logic Pattern: Pick Optimal

In this example, we leverage AI by providing a list of suppliers and the selection criteria (*"finding the optimal Product Supplier based on cost, lead time, and world conditions"*).  


&nbsp;
**Pattern: AI Intelligent Selection From Options**
&nbsp;

     Invoke AI providing a prompt (*find optimal <criteria>*) and a *list of candidates*.
     
     AI computes the selected object.

     Examples:

     1. Choose Optimal Supplier (this example)
     2. Shipping Carrier/Route Selection
     3. Dynamic Pricing/Discount Strategy
     4. Task/Resource Assignment
     5. Inventory Sourcing/Replenishment
&nbsp;
<br>

## Design

### Data Model

Observe:

1. Products can have multiple suppliers (selection candidates)
2. The Audit table `SysSupplierReq` - rows are created for each AI request

### AI Code Generation via Context Engineering

AI was not *born* understanding how to use rules to solve this.  We provide extensive context engineering to automate this pattern.

AI can not only create the implementation, it can explain it:

## AI Supplier Selection Logic Flow

**Initiating Event**: When an Item is inserted or its `product_id` changes

**Flow** (see files under `logic/logic_discovery/place_order`):

1. **Early Row Event on Item Fires** - see `./check_credit.py`

    - Early row event: `set_item_unit_price_from_supplier()`
    - Checks if suppliers exist for the product (fallback to Product.unit_price if no suppliers)
    - Invokes wrapper

2. **Wrapper Function** invokes request pattern on `SysSupplierReq`

    - See `./ai_requests/supplier_selection.py` -- `get_supplier_selection_from_ai()` 
    - Hides complexity from rule, above, by using the *Request Pattern*:

        - Creates new `SysSupplierReq` row instance
        - Sets parent context links (`product_id`, `item_id`)
        - Inserts the request row: `SysSupplierReq` - runs its logic...
   
3. Insert →  ***early_row_event:*** `select_supplier_via_ai()` - *Request Pattern* implementation

    - See same file: `./ai_requests/supplier_selection.py`
    - Get world conditions from `config/ai_test_context.yaml` (e.g., "Suez Canal blocked")
    - Sends supplier data (cost, lead time, region) + world conditions to OpenAI
    - AI analyzes and selects optimal supplier
    - Populates `SysSupplierReq` result fields: `chosen_supplier_id`, `chosen_unit_price`, `reason`, `request`

4. **Wrapper Returns** → Returns populated `SysSupplierReq` row with AI results

    - Caller extracts: `supplier_req.chosen_unit_price`
    - Item's `unit_price` is set from this AI-chosen value

5. **Standard Rule Chaining provides Governance**: Formula rules automatically recalculate `Item.amount` → `Order.amount_total` → `Customer.balance`, triggering credit limit constraint check

**Key Pattern**: 

1. The ***request pattern*** is commonly used to insert a row, where logic (such as `early_row_event`) provides integration services (e.g, invoke AI, messaging, email, etc), with automatic request auditing 
2. The wrapper hides Request Pattern complexity - caller just gets back a populated row object with AI results (`chosen_supplier_id`, `chosen_unit_price`, `reason`) plus full audit trail.
