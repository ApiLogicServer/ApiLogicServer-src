Departments own a series of General Ledger Accounts.

Departments also own Department Charge Definitions — each defines what percent
of an allocated cost flows to each of the Department's GL Accounts.
An active Department Charge Definition must cover exactly 100% (derived: 
total_percent = sum of lines; is_active = 1 when total_percent == 100).

Project Funding Definitions define which Departments fund a designated percent
of a Project's costs, and which Department Charge Definition each Department
applies. An active Project Funding Definition must cover exactly 100% (derived:
total_percent = sum of lines; is_active = 1 when total_percent == 100).

Projects are assigned to a Project Funding Definition.

When a Charge is received against a Project, cascade-allocate it in two levels:
  Level 1 — allocate the Charge amount to each Department per their 
             Project Funding Line percent → creates ChargeDeptAllocation rows
  Level 2 — allocate each ChargeDeptAllocation amount to that Department's 
             GL Accounts per their Charge Definition line percents
             → creates ChargeGlAllocation rows

Constraint: a Charge may only be posted if the Project's 
Project Funding Definition is active.
