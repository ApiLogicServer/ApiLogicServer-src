Create a table SysEmail in `database/db.sqlite` as a child of customer, 
with columns id, message, subject, customer_id and CreatedOn.

Add an after_flush event on SysEmail to produce a log message "email sent",
unless the customer has opted out.

List the orders date_shipped is null and CreatedOn before 2023-07-14, 
and send a discount email (subject: 'Discount Offer') to the customer for each one.
