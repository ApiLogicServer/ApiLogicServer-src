You can declare logic in `declare_logic.py`,
but that can lead to a lot of rules in 1 file.

A *best practice* is to create logic files in this directory,
named after the use case (e.g., `check_credit.py`).  

The easiest way to to copy/paste `use_case.py` to a new file, then
add your logic either by Natural Language (use your Coding Assistant, such as CoPilot),
or your IDE's code completion.
