Feature: Kafka Publish Shipping Notification

  Scenario: Notify shipping when an order is dispatched
    Given an Order exists
    When date_shipped is set
    Then publish to Kafka topic order_shipping
    And use message_formats/order_shipping.json as the message shape
    And use by-example publish rather than key-only publish
