<br>2. **Activated** on server start
<br>3. **Executed** - *automatically* -  on updates (using SQLAlchemy events)
<br>4. **Debugged** in your IDE, and with the console log

## Natural Language vs. IDE

If you are using WebGenAI, you can specify rules in Natural Language. You can also augment them in the IDE using code completion.  There are some important usage guidelines.  

> You should generally not alter any files in the `wg_rules` directory.  For more information, see [WebGenAI](https://apilogicserver.github.io/Docs/WebGenAI/), and [WebGenAI Logic](https://apilogicserver.github.io/Docs/WebGenAI-CLI.md#natural-language-logic).

## Examples      
Examples from tutorial project:
* Examples drawn from [tutorial project](https://github.com/ApiLogicServer/demo/blob/main/logic/declare_logic.py)
* Use Shift + "." to view in project mode

You can [find the rules here](https://apilogicserver.github.io/Docs/Logic).  Below, we explore the syntax of 3 typical rules.

&nbsp;

### 1. Multi-Table Derivations

This declares the Customer.Balance as the sum of the unshipped Order.AmountTotal:

```python
    Rule.sum(derive=models.Customer.Balance,
            as_sum_of=models.Order.AmountTotal,
            where=lambda row: row.ShippedDate is None)
```
It means the rule engine **watches** for these changes:
* Order inserted/deleted, or
* AmountTotal or ShippedDate or CustomerID changes

Iff changes are detected, the engine **reacts** by *adjusting* the Customer.Balance.  SQLs are [optimized](#declarative-logic-important-notes).

This would **chain** to check the Customers' Constraint rule, described below.

&nbsp;

### 2. Constraints: lambda or function

Constraints are multi-field conditions which must be true for transactions to succeed (else an exception is raised).  You can express the condition as a lambda or a function:

**As a lambda:**
```python
    Rule.constraint(validate=models.Customer,
        as_condition=lambda row: row.Balance <= row.CreditLimit,  # parent references are supported
        error_msg="balance ({row.Balance}) exceeds credit ({row.CreditLimit})")
```

**Or, as a function:**
```python
    def check_balance(row: models.Customer, old_row: models.Customer, logic_row: LogicRow):
        if logic_row.ins_upd_dlt != "dlt":  # see also: logic_row.old_row
            return row.Balance <= row.CreditLimit
        else:
            return True

    Rule.constraint(validate=models.Customer,
        calling=check_balance,
        error_msg=f"balance ({row.Balance}) exceeds credit ({row.CreditLimit})")
```

&nbsp;

### 3. Row Events: Extensible with Python

Events are procedural Python code, providing extensibility for declarative rules:
```python
    def congratulate_sales_rep(row: models.Order, old_row: models.Order, logic_row: LogicRow):
        pass  # event code here - sending email, messages, etc.

    Rule.commit_row_event(on_class=models.Order, calling=congratulate_sales_rep)
```
Note there are multiple kinds of events, so you can control whether they run before or after rule execution.  For more information, [see here](https://apilogicserver.github.io/Docs/Logic-Type-Constraint).

&nbsp;

## LogicRow: old_row, verb, etc

A key argument to functions is `logic_row`:

* **Wraps row and old_row,** plus methods for insert, update and delete - rule enforcement

* **Additional instance variables:** ins_upd_dlt, nest_level, session, etc.

* **Helper Methods:** are_attributes_changed, set_same_named_attributes, get_parent_logic_row(role_name), get_derived_attributes, log, is_inserted, etc

Here is an example:

```python
"""
    STATE TRANSITION LOGIC, using old_row
"""
def raise_over_20_percent(row: models.Employee, old_row: models.Employee, logic_row: LogicRow):
    if logic_row.ins_upd_dlt == "upd" and row.Salary > old_row.Salary:
        return row.Salary >= Decimal('1.20') * old_row.Salary
    else:
        return True

Rule.constraint(validate=models.Employee,
                calling=raise_over_20_percent,
                error_msg="{row.LastName} needs a more meaningful raise")
```

Note the `log` method, which enables you to write row/old_row into the log with a short message:

```python
logic_row.log("no manager for this order's salesrep")
```

&nbsp;

## Declarative Logic: Important Notes

Logic *declarative*, which differs from conventional *procedural* logic:

1. **Automatic Invocation:** you don't call the rules; they execute in response to updates (via SQLAlchemy events).

2. **Automatic Ordering:** you don't order the rules; execution order is based on system-discovered depencencies.

3. **Automatic Optimizations:** logic is optimized to reduce SQLs.

    * Rule execution is *pruned* if dependent attributes are not altered
    * SQL is optimized, e.g., `sum` rules operate by *adjustment*, not expensive SQL `select sum`

These simplify maintenance / iteration: you can be sure new logic is always called, in the correct order.

&nbsp;

## Debugging

Debug rules using **system-generated logic log** and your **IDE debugger**; for more information, [see here](https://apilogicserver.github.io/Docs/Logic-Use).

&nbsp;

### Using the debugger

Use the debugger as shown below.  Note you can stop in lambda functions.

&nbsp;

### Logic Log

Logging is performed using standard Python logging, with a logger named `logic_logger`.  Use `info` for tracing, and `debug` for additional information (e.g., all declared rules are logged).

In addition, the system logs all rules that fire, to aid in debugging.  Referring the the screen shot above:

*   Each line represents a rule execution, showing row state (old/new values), and the _{reason}_ that caused the update (e.g., client, sum adjustment)
*   Log indention shows multi-table chaining

&nbsp;

## How Logic works

*Activation* occurs in `api_logic_server_run.py`:
```python
    LogicBank.activate(session=session, activator=declare_logic, constraint_event=constraint_handler)
```

This installs the rule engine as a SQLAlchemy event listener (`before_flush`).  So, Logic *runs* automatically, in response to transaction commits (typically via the API).

Rules plug into SQLAlchemy events, and execute as follows:

| Logic Phase | Why It Matters |
|:-----------------------------|:---------------------|
| **Watch** for changes at the attribute level | Performance - Automatic Attribute-level Pruning |
| **React** by recomputing value | Ensures Reuse - Invocation is automatic<br>Derivations are optimized (e.g. *adjustment updates* - not aggregate queries) |
| **Chain** to other referencing data | Simplifies Maintenance - ordering is automatic<br>Multi-table logic automation |
