Create a system with customers, orders, items and products.

Include a notes field for orders.

Enforce the Check Credit requirement (do not generate check constraints):
1. Customer.balance <= credit_limit
2. Customer.balance = Sum(Order.amount_total where date_shipped is null)
3. Order.amount_total = Sum(Item.amount)
4. Item.amount = quantity * unit_price
5. Store the Item.unit_price as a copy from Product.unit_price
