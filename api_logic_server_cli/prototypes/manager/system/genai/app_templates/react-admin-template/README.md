# Getting Started with Genai-Logic react-admin

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).  For more information, see [README_create_react_app](README_create_react_app.md).

GenAI-Logic then updated the `src` folder to create your app, from:

* <manager>/api_logic_server_cli/prototypes/manager/system/genai/app_templates/app_learning
* your database models

# To run the app:

```bash
cd ui/react-admin
npm install
npm start
```
