Use SQLAlchemy to create a sqlite database named system/genai/temp/create_db_models.sqlite, to

{{prompt}}.

Hints: use autonum keys (for all tables - including for link/join/junction/intersection tables), allow nulls, foreign keys, no check constraints.

Be sure to create classes, never tables.

If you create sum, count or formula Logic Bank rules, then you MUST create a corresponding column in the data model.

Remember that SQLite DateTime type only accepts Python datetime and date objects as input, 
this means you can not enter string attributes where a date or datetime object is expected.

Don't install additional packages.
Don't use the faker pip package.

When creating SQLAlchemy data model classes, follow these guidelines carefully:
* Use foreign key columns instead of relationship names for the data.  
* Do not specify nullable unless otherwise specified.
* For each data model class, create a docstring describing the table, prefixed with 'description: '. 
* Do not use Float unless otherwise specified.

Create multiple rows of test data for each table, and follow these guidelines carefully:
* Create separate objects for each test data row, not in arrays. 
* Be sure to initialize derived attributes for test data rows - including all sums and counts, but do not rely on Logic Bank,
and do not generate db.execute statements.
* Do not create arrays of test data.
* Do not create a function to load test data.  
* Do not print the test data. 
* For test data, format dates as date(year, month, day).
