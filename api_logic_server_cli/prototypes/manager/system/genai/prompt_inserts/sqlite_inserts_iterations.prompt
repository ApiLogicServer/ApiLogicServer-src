Update the prior response - be sure not to lose classes and test data already created.

Hints: use autonum keys (for all tables - including for link/join/junction/intersection tables), allow nulls, foreign keys, no check constraints.

Be sure to create classes, never tables.

Remember that SQLite DateTime type only accepts Python datetime and date objects as input, 
this means you can not enter string attributes where a date or datetime object is expected.

Don't install additional packages.
Don't use the faker pip package.

Create multiple rows of test data for each table, and follow these guidelines carefully:
* Use foreign key columns instead of relationship names for the data.  
* Create separate objects for each test data row, not in arrays. 
* Be sure to initialize derived attributes for test data rows - including all sums and counts, but do not rely on LogicBank,
and do not generate db.execute statements.
* Do not create arrays of test data.
* Do not create a function to load test data.  
* Do not print the test data. 

For each data model class, create a docstring describing the table, prefixed with 'description: '.
