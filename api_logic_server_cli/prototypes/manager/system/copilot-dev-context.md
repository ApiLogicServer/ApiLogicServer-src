# Context Restoration: BLT Manager Workspace

**Purpose:** This file re-establishes AI assistant context after BLT runs regenerate this workspace.

&nbsp;

## 🎯 YOU ARE HERE: BLT Manager (Nested Workspace)

**Current Location:** `~/dev/ApiLogicServer/ApiLogicServer-dev/build_and_test/ApiLogicServer/`

This is the **BLT Manager** - a nested workspace that gets regenerated by the Build-Load-Test process.

**Directory Structure:**
```
~/dev/ApiLogicServer/ApiLogicServer-dev/          # Seminal Manager (stable)
├── build_and_test/
│   └── ApiLogicServer/                           # ← YOU ARE HERE (BLT Manager)
│       ├── samples/                              # Sample/test projects
│       ├── venv/                                 # Shared venv for test projects
│       ├── .github/.copilot-profile.md           # This file
│       └── docs/training/                        # Training materials
└── org_git/
    ├── ApiLogicServer-src/                       # Framework source (edit here)
    └── Docs/                                     # Documentation project
```

**Key Facts:**
- This workspace is **regenerated** with each BLT run
- Sample projects live here for testing
- Has its own venv shared by test projects
- Framework changes happen in `org_git/ApiLogicServer-src/`

## 📚 Complete Architecture Documentation

**For comprehensive technical context, read:**

### [Architecture-Internals.md](https://apilogicserver.github.io/Docs/Architecture-Internals/)

This document contains **everything** you need to understand the system:

1. **Technology Lineage** - 40+ years of proven history:
   - Wang Labs PACE (6,000+ customers, 1980s-1990s)
   - Versata ($3.4B startup, Fortune 500 deployments, 1990s-2010s)
   - API Logic Server (modern cloud-native evolution, 2020s-present)

2. **Declarative Architecture** - The NL → DSL → Engines pattern:
   - Why rules are mandatory (correctness guarantee)
   - Dependency chains and automatic completeness
   - Database, API, UI, Logic engines

3. **Nested Manager Architecture** - Critical development structure:
   - Seminal Manager vs. BLT Manager (nested)
   - Development workflow: edit → BLT → test
   - Why this architecture exists

4. **Installation & Development Procedures** - How to work with the system:
   - Manager installation (`install-ApiLogicServer-dev.sh`)
   - Running BLT (Build-Load-Test)
   - Critical smoke test procedures
   - Ongoing development workflows

5. **Cross-References** - Complete navigation map to all documentation

## 🧭 Documentation Navigation Map

### For AI Assistants Working on Framework Internals:
- **[Architecture-Internals.md](https://apilogicserver.github.io/Docs/Architecture-Internals/)** - Complete technical architecture (read this first)
- **[Medium Article](https://medium.com/@valjhuber/declarative-genai-the-architecture-behind-enterprise-vibe-automation-1b8a4fe4fbd7)** - Architectural rationale and NL→DSL→Engines pattern

### For Creating New Projects:
- **Manager-level `.copilot-instructions.md`** - How to CREATE projects (in workspace root)
- Sample databases and `genai-logic create` / `genai-logic genai` commands

### For Working Within Created Projects:
- **Project-level `.copilot-instructions.md`** - How to EXTEND/CUSTOMIZE projects (auto-generated in each project)
- **`docs/training/logic_bank_api.prompt`** - LogicBank API reference (Rosetta Stone for rules)
- **`docs/training/testing.md`** - Behave testing guide (1755 lines, read BEFORE creating tests)

### For End Users:

## 🤖 AI Assistant Quick Reference

### Two Working Modes:
- **Author-Val** (Developer/Maintainer) - Working on framework internals, debugging, testing
- **User-Val** (Simulating End Users) - Testing product workflows, creating demos, validating UX

### Context Establishment Protocol:
1. **Read [Architecture-Internals.md](https://apilogicserver.github.io/Docs/Architecture-Internals/)** for complete technical context
2. Identify which documentation to consult based on task:
   - Framework development → Architecture-Internals.md
   - Project creation → Manager-level `.copilot-instructions.md`
   - Project customization → Project-level `.copilot-instructions.md`
   - Adding logic → `docs/training/logic_bank_api.prompt`
   - Creating tests → `docs/training/testing.md`
3. When role unclear, ask: "Are you testing as a user or working on internals?"

### Key Principles:
- **Assume deep technical expertise** - Technology refined over 40+ years
- **Focus on efficient execution** - Less explanation, more action
- **Respect the architecture** - Patterns represent battle-tested solutions from thousands of deployments
- **Check training materials** - `logic_bank_api.prompt` and `testing.md` prevent common AI mistakes

## 🔄 Development Workflow

**Source Repository:** https://github.com/ApiLogicServer/ApiLogicServer-src

**Local Dev Path:** `/Users/val/dev/ApiLogicServer/ApiLogicServer-dev/org_git/ApiLogicServer-src`

**Workflow:**
1. Edit framework code in `org_git/ApiLogicServer-src/`
2. Run BLT from Seminal Manager (rebuilds, tests, regenerates this workspace)
3. Test with sample projects in this workspace
4. Sync templates back to `ApiLogicServer-src`
5. Push to GitHub

**BLT (Build-Load-Test):**
- Rebuilds API Logic Server from dev source
- Creates ~18 test projects with validation
- Critical smoke test before pushing to GitHub
- Results in `tests/results.txt` and `tests/failures.txt`
