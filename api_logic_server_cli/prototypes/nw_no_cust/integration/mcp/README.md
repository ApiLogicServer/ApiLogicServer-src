Model Context Protocol is a way for Chat agents to discover and call external servers, be they databases, APIs, file systems, etc, and call their services. Â And, for multiple such servers to be choreographed in a chain of calls.

## ChatGPT testing

In the Manager, open `samples/nw_sample_nocust`, and explore `integration/mcp`.  This has been successfully used to invoke the server.

This is just an initial experiment, without automation such as creation of openAI version 3 from version 2.  Many substantive issues need to be addressed, including but not limited to security, update, etc.

We welcome participation in this exploration.  Please contact us via [discord](https://discord.gg/HcGxbBsgRF){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.
