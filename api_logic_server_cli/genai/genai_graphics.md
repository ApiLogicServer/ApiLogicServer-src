### Tests

| Case           | From Demo      | Normal | Notes |
| :------------- | :------------- | :----- | :----- |
| Change Model   | Lost (1)
| Rules
| Both


### Notes:

1. demo prompt is wrong, so its graphics lost
2. Many failures (Sales vs Sale, sql 'extract', ...) ==> badly need a delete/repair
3. Iterations definitely driven by docs/response, but
    * Bad-g-1 then add g-2, lost g-1
    * Bug: add g must add to docs/response
