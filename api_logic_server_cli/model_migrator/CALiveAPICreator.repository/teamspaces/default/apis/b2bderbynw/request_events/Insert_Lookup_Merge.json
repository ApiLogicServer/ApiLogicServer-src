  "comments": "Partners cannot supply Part *Numbers* in their orders - they do not and should not know them.   So, LAC provides LOOKUP actions (see the @metadata tag in the json example below) in the request json, to LOOKUP a ProductNumber given a ProductName.   Note these are used on in conjunction with the Resource property \"Part of Defined Key\", which defines what value(s) are used for the LOOKUP.  Examine the PartnerOrder resource, and observe this on the Product and Shipper Subresources.\n\nHowever, such @metadata tags inclusion are also unreasonable to request from partners, since they are rather non-standard JSON.  So, you can use Request Events to modify the incoming request json, here to insert metadata tags.  After insertion, the resultant json looks like this...\n\n{\n   \"Product\":{\n      \"@metadata\":{ \"action\":\"LOOKUP\" },\n      \"ProductName\":\"Uncle Bob's Organic Dried Pears\"\n     },\n     \"Quantity\":2\n     },\n\n*****\nSuppliers can create / update their information - self service.  Posts through the SupplierSelfService can result in either:\n   * a set of inserts if the new data does not exist\n   * a set of updates if the data already exists, per \"Part of Defined Key\" (see SupplierSelfService attributes).\n\nThis is termed \"Merge Insert\".  It is activated by the metadata action tag MERGE_INSERT, above.",
