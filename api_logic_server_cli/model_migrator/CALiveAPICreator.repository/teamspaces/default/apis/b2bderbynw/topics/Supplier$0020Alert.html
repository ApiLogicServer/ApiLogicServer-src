<h2>Business Background</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Story: Place Order</h3>

<p>As a Business Owner,&nbsp;</p>

<p>I want to enable Partners to Place Orders via RESTful APIs and Web/Mobile Appis,</p>

<p>So that they can self-serve to&nbsp;reduce&nbsp;their / our Adminstration Costs, and reduce delays.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr />
<h3>Acceptance Criteria: Supplier Alert</h3>

<p>Given a Supplier (such as Pavlov) that has reqistered a Webhook (in <code>Supplier.URL)</code>,</p>

<p>When an order is placed containing any of their products,</p>

<p>Then ensure that the system Posts a message to the Supplier in an agreed-upon API format (per <code>SupplierAlert</code>).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr />
<h2>Technical Approach:</h2>

<ol>
	<li>On each Order Details, accrue the webHook URLs, using <code>B2B.putPropertyMap</code></li>
	<li>On Order, process each accrued WebHook URL,&nbsp;by calling <code>B2B.transformToWebHook</code></li>
</ol>
