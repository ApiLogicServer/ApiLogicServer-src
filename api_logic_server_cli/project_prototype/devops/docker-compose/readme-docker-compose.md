Use docker compose to choreograph multiple services (e.g, your application, database and web server) for a multi-tiered system.

For an example using postgres / Northwind, [click here](https://github.com/ApiLogicServer/docker-compose-nw-postgres).

The docker files in this directory are from that project.  To adapt them to your own project, you will need to update the database section of `docker-compose.yml`.
