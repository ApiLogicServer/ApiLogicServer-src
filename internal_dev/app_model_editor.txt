Usability
    - Entering id causes errors - either default it, or make me provide unique textual name
        - And tab-out to enable save button is unfortunate
    - Big Process Yaml button is unclear
    - Don't understand checkboxes for download and process-yaml
        - Click Process Yaml big button with download reset - right side not filled in
        - Click Download Yaml and save fills in right side - why?
        - "                           " creates system/app_model_editor/ui/app_model_merge.yaml?
            - And did not save my altered attribute label
            - Which, by following the procedure above, is not removed from the database (user cries).
    - Entity/Attributes appear to be updatable
    - Where did the download file go?  (system/app_model_editor/ui/yaml/app_model_merge.yaml?)
    - Using NW, confusion about which is current (vs the pre-created one)
    - Title is not really supported - should not be there
    - Does Manager readme need a link to AME doc?
