The BLT failed on 2 macs, and parallels ubuntu and win11.

No venv worked
    python3 -m build
    val@Vals-MPB-14 ApiLogicServer-src % python3 -m build --version
        build 1.1.1 (/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.12/lib/python3.12/site-packages/build)
        val@Vals-MPB-14 ApiLogicServer-src %

The venv is 1.2.1.  Maybe it's the build version?

You can run build shell , which works (!) under the venv
    cd tests/build_and_test
    sh build_install.sh python3
    # see tests/build_and_test/build_install.sh

Maybe it's the build_install returning bad return code?
