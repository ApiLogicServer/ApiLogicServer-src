The Diego Lo Giudice challenge:
    WG_Team: new rules, attributes
    Dev_Team: same, using either genai or alembic...

Groundrules:
    No Dev_Team -> WG_Team integration (just deploy Dev_Team and use)
    WG_Team - serial dev
    WG_Team logic files are separate from Dev_Team

Key Idea: is 'source of truth' the genai/response files, or the .py files?
    Seems like:
        Dev_Team: .py 
            Probably a fixup bug (is ignoring these)
        WG_Team: WG_Results json files  
            Are these maintained in WG db?  Seems like they'd have to be...
                It's all the WG_Team Sees
                And they need to be able to delete them.
                Does this hold true over multiple iterations?
