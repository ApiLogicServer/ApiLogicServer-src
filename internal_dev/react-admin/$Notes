API Logic Server execution requires an SRA (Safrs React Admin) build in ApiLogicServer/api_logic_server_cli/create_from_model.  It is *not* built into the source tree - you must build it, or expand a built release (recommended).

Built releases (recommended)
    There are available in the Docs-ApiLogicServer project. 
    The one without the date is GA, the others are dev (test) releases
    Expand zip into ApiLogicServer/api_logic_server_cli/create_from_model.


Building SRA (not recommended)
    Overview (internal notes - advise skipping these):
        * Val has altered the files in /code
            * menu.js - hello screen, links to swagger and docs
            * config.js
                * loads admin.yaml from disk
                    * if missing, uses config.json import (as as to run without LAC)
                * converts admin-attributes (if present) to admin-column for internal admin app use
                    * Detects and does not convert admin-column; this enables testing of load vs conversion
        * to release ALS - see ApiLogicServer/$readme.txt

    This directory contains various yaml files, and their json equivalents, for test compares.

    Update 11/24 - parent joins, child grids running
        * running with admin-attr, admin-col
        * minimal constraint handling

    Update 11/26
        * added code to obtain the search property (it works!)
        * altered directory structure (react-admin is now a top-level project folder)

    Update 12/2
        * Safrs-react-admin (non-NPM) works with https://github.com/thomaxxl/safrs-react-admin
            ** paste, and manage/load
        * Safrs-react-admin (non-NPM) works with created admin.yml
            ** paste

    Avoiding redundant parent joins - better approach than "use these attributes"
        * Instead, "skip these attributes" - better...
            * smaller raml to read
            * better re-use of grid attr defs
        * Should it be <attr> or <fk-name> - whichever is easier...

    Proposed Release criteria (Val)
    * Technology Preview - public pip/docker release, low key (Legend: + working, - todo, ? needs discussion)
        + Works from ApiLogicServer run, all browsers
        + Admin-attributes, loaded from created project (many properties may be ignored)
        + Admin page has link to swagger
        +- Works in VSCode (the missing menu can be a doc'd bug if fix is not easy / obvious)
        + Joins - parent & child, any sensible default
        - Filter (working, 3.50.17, failing 3.50.24)
        + Constraint retry (show message, return to page, retype all changes, but way better than flask appBuilder)
        - All pages work for test DBs; many issues - see...
            https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DzJXwVQoTGgJcfXvvPGCczgEVG-s9g72vB6AfJSJIVc/edit#heading=h.z54llfjeay3x)
        - Pagination not showing up for sample db
        ? Might be nice to add just a bit of style to grid headers
        ? Might be nice to limit grids to @7 cols (there is a settingsmax_list_columns object in admin.yaml)
        ? Currency display (decimal digits)
        ? Custom home component
    * Announcement (articles, videos etc)
        - Lookups!!
        - Add order - cascade add (set OrderDetail.OrderId from Order), lookup OrderDetail.Product
        - Constraint retry (show message, stay on page, fix {preserved} changes and retry, or cancel)
        * PythonAnywhere demo (combined app/api)
        ? Image? Link? Money?  Date?
        - Notes (for demo self-discovery)
        - Join attrs - explicit from admin (so avoid redundant master)
    * Key Futures
        * Hide / Show
        * Set attr=value, save (e.g., checkout, approve, etc)
