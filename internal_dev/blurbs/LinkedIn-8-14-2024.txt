Excited to share that we can now demonstrate something so powerful, that I would have regarded it as technically impossible less than a year ago.

A website that accepts a Natural Language prompt, and provides instant working software: a database and a API-based Web App. 
 
This is orders of magnitude faster and simpler than Low Code database designers and screen painters, not to mention frameworks.

It's on the web, so you can collaborate with your colleagues with live screens and data, and iterate in minutes -- just submit another prompt.

Building out the system is a breeze.  Download the complete running project. Use standard tools like your IDE, Python, GitHub, and libraries such as Flask and SQLAlchemy -- friendly to your IT team. 

For example, you can enhance it with Kafka for Application Integration.

What's more, declaring spreadsheet-like rules for logic and security is 40 times more concise than manual coding -- a breakthrough for backend logic (typically nearly half the effort). 

Lastly, create containers using supplied scripts, and deploying them anywhere -- it works with your preferred infrastructure.
