run imports Config.args
    Config imports auth_provider -> Authentication_models, which imports SAFRSBaseX
        SAFRSBaseX impprts Config.Args is not yet loaded.
            Config.Args wants access to config variables

The ont_exp_config_prop branch went to great lengths to address.
While it can create/run an app, 
    the BLT tests fail in test_utils, since the Config.Security_PROVIDER is None.
    It was, of course set, so it's unclear what's happening.

Not investigated - put the import in a function instead of top...

Consequently, that branch is abandoned.  
    We will need to manually uncomment the code in SAFRSBaseX.
