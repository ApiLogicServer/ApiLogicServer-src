mycircles - CoPilot finds:
    Mis-spelling
        The filename is DailyReponseCount.js (missing 's' in "Response")
        The exports inside the file are correctly named DailyResponseCountList, DailyResponseCountShow, etc. (with the 's')
        The imports in App.js were trying to import DailyReponseCountList, DailyReponseCountShow, etc. (missing 's')
    And then
        src/User.js
