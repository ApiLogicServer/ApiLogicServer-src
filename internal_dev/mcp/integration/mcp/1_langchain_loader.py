==========================================================================================
 LangChain OpenAPI Loader â€“ JSON:API Planner Tool (1_langchain_loader.py)
==========================================================================================

Alert:
------
This does not work - hours of import version madness.


Purpose:
--------
This script loads an OpenAPI 3.0 specification (e.g., nw_swagger_3.yaml) using LangChain's
OpenAPI tools to dynamically generate a structured LangChain Tool. It can be used as a 
building block in an AI system that automatically interprets natural language goals and 
calls API endpoints by mapping them to OpenAPI operations.

How It's Used:
--------------
- Reads the OpenAPI schema and extracts available endpoints.
- Instantiates a tool for a specific operation (e.g., getCustomer).
- Allows GPT agents or scripts to call the tool using structured input.
- Typically used in multi-agent or planner + executor systems (e.g., AutoGen, LangGraph).
- It is *not* required to run integration/mcp/3_executor_test_agent.py 

Limitations:
------------
- This script does not itself parse natural language input.
- The operation_id must be known and match one in the OpenAPI spec.
- Requires LangChain and OpenAPI tool support installed.

Dependencies:
-------------
- langchain
- openapi-spec-validator

Recommended Next Step:
----------------------
Use this in conjunction with a GPT planner that:
1. Converts natural language into structured intent.
2. Selects the correct operation_id.
3. Provides parameters as expected by the OpenAPI operation.
