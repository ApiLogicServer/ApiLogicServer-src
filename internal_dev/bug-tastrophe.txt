Here's how to waste 4 hours of a beautiful day, with serious risk of lost sanity:

    1. modified genai, which is called by cli with catch so we can retry 3 times.

    2. genai includes write-diagnostics, which is (by design) try/catch/ignore.

    3. run blt, which obscures logs.

    4. own bug in write-diagnostics, using same (copied) text in a catch.
