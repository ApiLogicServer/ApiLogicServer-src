Existing Systems Initiative - way more existing systems than new ones

    Value Props center around leveraging these for extension, integration:
        - instantly mcp-fy your legacy DB, including critical business logic and security.
        -instantly expose legacy DBs to Natural Language, including critical business logic and security, to simplify user discovery and operation.
            - it's where users "already are"
            - add ChatBot to extend to Discord, Slack, Teams? 
                1.	User types in Slack:
                    → “What’s the balance for customer ALFKI?”
                2.	Slack bot receives → forwards to backend
                3.	Backend passes query to GPT function-calling-enabled model
                4.	GPT emits: GET /Customer?filter[id]=ALFKI
                5.	Backend executes API call to your database/API
                6.	Returns balance → formats reply:
                    → “Customer ALFKI has a balance of $23,000.”
                7.	Sends reply message into Slack thread

    Thoughts:
        MCP
            - Blockers, but value in marketing
            - Need a compelling example (GPT: check credit as multi-mcp flow... good grief)
            - Interesting contrast: deterministic work flow vs non-deterministic AI flow
                - several N8N demos might be truly compelling
        NLQ - explore
            - compelling value?  get some feedback
            - security
            - update
            - pruning the openapi
            - Mgmt
                - how does user know about the various 'functions'
                - how does org make functions available
        Demos
            - Not too fancy - excessive tech can be confusing / distracting (does this apply to NL API Creation?)
            - Must clarify leverage logic & security (vs just api)

These have already been vetted by Customers / Prod Mgmt (we know they are valuable)

    Add Security to WebG?

    Python 3.13

    Rule Event/Condition Actions (ECA when order shipped, send order to Kafka and n8n email to manager, Nat Lang)

    API Entity Actions (set <field> = <value>... toggle on_hold, ship, etc)

    Clean up custom endpoint 'extra methods'

    Nat Lang Copy, Allocate (apply Payment to Outstanding Orders, Bonus to Dept members, ...)

    Rules by UseCase (discovery)

    Example: AIDev (show what's possible, eg, cursor)


Further Out

    Test Case Creation - can we create the BLT tests used for SampleDB?
        Longer term, probably best done with Design Partners per their actual practice.
