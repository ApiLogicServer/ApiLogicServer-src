API Logic Server / GenAI Microservice Automation has turned your prompt into a microservice; explore it:

1. A ***multi-table* application** - explore the links at left

2. A **standard *multi-table* JSON:API** - [explore Open API here]()

</br>

## TL;DR - instant working software, standards-based customization and deployment

<summary>Instant Microservice, Customize with Declarative Rules and Python in your IDE</summary>

From a simple Natural Language Prompt (or existing database) - no db design, framework, screen painting - you get:

1. **Working Software** - ready for collaboration and iteration. <br>

2. A project you can [**customize in your IDE**](https://apilogicserver.github.io/Docs/Tutorial/#3-customize-and-debug-in-your-ide) with Python, eg:

    * [declarative security](https://apilogicserver.github.io/Docs/Security-Overview/): keycloak authentication, role-based row authorization<br>

    * [declarative business logic](): multi-table constraints and derivations using rules that are 40X more concise than code, extensible with Python<br>

    * application integration (e.g., [kafka messaging](https://apilogicserver.github.io/Docs/Sample-Integration/)), <br>

3. Deploy...

### Hover text

If possible, hover text for:

* *multi-table* multi-page app: Applications providing multiple pages, e.g. a Customer Page and an Order Page, with filtering, pagination and sorting

* *multi-table* api: self-serve (analogous to GraphQL), with pagination, optimistic locking, filtering, sorting, and related data access
