Without framework coding, database design or screen painting, you have

1. A ***multi-table* application** - explore the links at left

2. A **standard *multi-table* JSON:API** - [click here]

</br>

## What Just Happened

From a simple Natural Language Prompt (or existing database), you get:

1. Multi-table App & API - no db design, framework, screen painting <br>

2. Download the project to [customize in your IDE](https://apilogicserver.github.io/Docs/Tutorial/#3-customize-and-debug-in-your-ide) with Python, eg:

    * [declarative security](https://apilogicserver.github.io/Docs/Security-Overview/): role-based row filtering<br>

    * [declarative business logic](): 40x more concise for multi-table constraints and derivations, extensible with Python<br>

    * application integration (e.g., [kafka messaging](https://apilogicserver.github.io/Docs/Sample-Integration/)), <br>

    * models vs code mess ?? tbd

### Hover text

If possible, hover text for:

* *multi-table* multi-page app: Applications providing multiple pages, e.g. a Customer Page and an Order Page, with filtering, pagination and sorting

* *multi-table* api: self-serve (analogous to GraphQL), with pagination, optimistic locking, filtering, sorting, and related data access
