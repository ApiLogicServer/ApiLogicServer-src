## Explore the created microservice in your Browser

API Logic Server / GenAI Microservice Automation has turned your prompt into a microservice; explore it:

1. A ***multi-table* application** - explore the links at left

2. A **standard *multi-table* JSON:API** - [click here]()

</br>

## TL;DR

From a simple Natural Language Prompt (or existing database), you get:

1. Multi-table App & API - no db design, framework, screen painting.  Your business idea, *running* - ready for collaboration and iteration. <br>

2. A project you can [customize in your IDE](https://apilogicserver.github.io/Docs/Tutorial/#3-customize-and-debug-in-your-ide) with Python, eg:

    * [declarative security](https://apilogicserver.github.io/Docs/Security-Overview/): keycloak authentication, role-based row authorization<br>

    * [declarative business logic](): multi-table constraints and derivations using rules that are 40X more concise than code, extensible with Python<br>

    * application integration (e.g., [kafka messaging](https://apilogicserver.github.io/Docs/Sample-Integration/)), <br>
