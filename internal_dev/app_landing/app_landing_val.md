<summary>1. Instant Working Software - Get the Requirements Right</summary>

Automation has turned your prompt into a microservice: a working **application**, and a **standard API.**

It simply cannot be faster or simpler.

* Eliminate weeks to months of complex framework coding, db design, or screen painting.  

* Iterate 15 times... before lunch.

<summary>2. Customize - Declarative Rules and Python in your IDE</summary>

The speed and simplicity of AI, plus all the flexibility of a framework.  

* Download the standard project, and [**customize in your IDE**](https://apilogicserver.github.io/Docs/Tutorial/#3-customize-and-debug-in-your-ide)

* Use standard Python: e.g. provide [Application integration](https://apilogicserver.github.io/Docs/Sample-Integration/) (custom APIs and kafka messaging) 

* [Declarative security](https://apilogicserver.github.io/Docs/Security-Overview/): configure keycloak authentication, declare role-based row authorization<br>

* [Declarative business logic](https://apilogicserver.github.io/Docs/Logic-Why/): multi-table constraints and derivations using ***unique rules*** that are 40X more concise than code, extensible with Python<br>
