<summary>TL;DR - Instant Microservice, Customize with Declarative Rules and Python in your IDE</summary>

From a simple Natural Language Prompt (or existing database), you get:

1. **Instant Working Software** - enables collaboration and iteration to *get the requirements right:*

    * Eliminate weeks to months of complex framework coding, db design, or screen painting.  
    
    * Iterate 15 times... before lunch.

2. **Standards-Based Customization** - speed and simplicity, plus all the flexibility of a framework.  You get a standard project you can download and [**customize in your IDE**](https://apilogicserver.github.io/Docs/Tutorial/#3-customize-and-debug-in-your-ide) with Python, eg:

    * [Declarative security](https://apilogicserver.github.io/Docs/Security-Overview/): configure keycloak authentication, declare role-based row authorization<br>

    * [Declarative business logic](https://apilogicserver.github.io/Docs/Logic-Why/): multi-table constraints and derivations using ***unique rules*** that are 40X more concise than code, extensible with Python.<br>

    * [Application integration](https://apilogicserver.github.io/Docs/Sample-Integration/) (e.g., custom APIs and kafka messaging). <br>

3. **Automated Open Deployment** - standard containers

    * Created projects include scripts to automate docker creation, so you can deploy anywhere.  
    
    * Open means no runtime fees, no lock-in.

### Hover text

If possible, hover text for:

* *multi-table* multi-page app: Applications providing multiple pages, e.g. a Customer Page and an Order Page, with filtering, pagination and sorting

* *multi-table* api: self-serve (analogous to GraphQL), with pagination, optimistic locking, filtering, sorting, and related data access
