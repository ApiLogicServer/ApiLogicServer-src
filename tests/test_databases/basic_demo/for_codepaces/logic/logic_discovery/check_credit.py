    Check Credit Use Case Logic
    
    Key Points:
    1. This logic was derived from Natural Language (included as comments below)
    2. It maintains the abstraction level: 5 rules, not 200 lines of FrankenCode
    3. As code, it works with Source Control, the debugger, code completion, and other tools
    4. It is automatically ordered, which simplified maintenance  (no more hunting for the right place to add a rule)
    5. It is automatically called, which ensures consistency and reduces errors through reuse over all Use Cases
