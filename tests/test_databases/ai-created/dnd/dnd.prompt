Use SQLAlchemy to create a sqlite database named system/genai/temp/model.sqlite  .
the purpose of the database is: dungeons and dragon

Create at least 25 tables.

Hints: use autonum keys, allow nulls, foreign keys, no check constraints.
If you choose to use a date, only use python datetime datatype.
Remember that SQLite DateTime type only accepts Python datetime and date objects as input, this means you can not enter string attributes where a date or datetime object is expected.
Don't use python DECIMAL type.
Don't install additional packages.
Don't use the faker pip package.

Create at least 100 rows of sample data, use foreign key columns instead of relationship names for the data inserts.
