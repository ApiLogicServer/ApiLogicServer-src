Use SQLAlchemy to create a sqlite database named system/genai/temp/create_db_models.sqlite, to

Create at least 13 tables.

Employee has a name and organization_name.

Departments have a Name and Location.

A ProjectAllocatorPlan has a name and date.
A ProjectAllocatorPlan has a list of DeptAllocators.
A DeptAllocator has a ProjectAllocatorPlan, a PercentAllocation, and a AccountAllocatorPlan.

Projects are assigned to a ProjectAllocatorPlan.

Derive the ProjectAllocatorPlan.TotalPercentAllocation as the sum of the DeptAllocator.PercentAllocation.

Projects have a ManagedBy Employee, and a ProjectAllocatorPlan.
Projects have a list of ProjectCharges, with a ChargeDate and ChargeAmount.

Accounts have a Name, Department, a ChargeBudget, and a list of ProjectCharges.
ProjectCharges have a ChargeAmount, a ProjectCharge, an Account, and a AccountAllocatorPlan.
Departments have a ManagedBy Employee, and a list of Accounts.

Derive Accounts.TotalChargeAmount as the sum of ProjectCharge.ChargeAmounts.
Validate that the Accounts TotalChargeAmount cannot exceed ChargeBudget.

Accounts have a list of AccountAllocatorPlans, a list of AccountAllocatorPlans, and a list of DeptAllocations.
DeptAllocation has a Account, and a ChargeAmount.
AccountAllocatorPlans have an Department, a list of AccountAllocators, and a list of AccountCharges.

An AccountAllocator has a Account and a PercentAllocation.

An AccountCharge has an ChargeAmount, and an Account.

Derive the AccountAllocatorPlan.Total as the sum of the AccountAllocator.PercentAllocation.

ProjectCharges are disbursed to ProjectCharges, according to the selected ProjectAllocatorPlan.

ProjectDeptAllocation are disbursed to DeptAllocation, according to the AccountAllocatorPlan.AccountAllocator.

Hints: use autonum keys, allow nulls, Decimal types, foreign keys, no check constraints, python datetime datatype.

Remember that SQLite DateTime type only accepts Python datetime and date objects as input, 
this means you can not enter string attributes where a date or datetime object is expected.

Don't install additional packages.
Don't use the faker pip package.

Create some test data, use foreign key columns - NOT relationship names - for the data .
