create an application to track the RFID ear tags on cattle and log each new location that a cow is located, the date and time of movement from one location to another, and the amount of food consumed by each cow and any medications required for a cow and also allow room to rate the cow's general level of happiness based on which music is playing in the barn when the cows are in their stalls.  The music genres should be Disco, Pop, Heavy Metal, or Classical.
