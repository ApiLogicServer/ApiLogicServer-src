Use SQLAlchemy to create a sqlite database named system/genai/temp/model.sqlite,
for an airport database.

Define at least 10 tables.

Hints: use autonum keys, allow nulls, foreign keys, no check constraints.
If you choose to use a date, only use python datetime datatype.
Remember that SQLite DateTime type only accepts Python datetime and date objects as input, this means you can not enter string attributes where a date or datetime object is expected.
Don't use python DECIMAL type

Create a few rows sample data.
