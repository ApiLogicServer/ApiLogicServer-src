This is just a playground.  It is not even close to working.

The general logic bank api requires activate etc etc,
all of which is in place in als.  

So the whole model is out of sync.
In fact, there's a different "api" for als/logicbank
    1. no activate
    2. required to use certain dir/file (logic/declare_logic.py),
    3. the imports are already done
    4. and **insert** into that (tho, maybe use discovery?)
