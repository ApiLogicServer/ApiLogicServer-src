This is just a playground.  It is not even close to working.

The general logic bank api requires activate etc etc,
all of which is in place in als.  

So the whole model is out of sync.
In fact, there's a different "api" for als/logicbank
    1. no activate
    2. required to use certain dir/file (logic/declare_logic.py),
    3. the imports are already done
    4. and **insert** into that (tho, maybe use discovery?)

10/4:
    We seem to be able to feed CPT the rules api and get a good solution
        see tests/test_databases/ai-created/genai_demo/genai_demo_logic/logic-transcript.md
    So maybe RAG is not required to achieve our purpose
    Also, for a conversation, probably only submit logic-api once:

10/4 oh my goodness
    use Run Config: genai LOGIC - clean/ApiLogicServer/genai_demo_logic
    it creates tests/test_databases/ai-created/genai_demo/genai_demo_logic/create_db_models.py
    which appears to be correct except for a few readmes.
