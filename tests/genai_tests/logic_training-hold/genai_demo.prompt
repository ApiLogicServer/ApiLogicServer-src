Create a system with customers, orders, items and products.

Include a notes field for orders.

Use LogicBank to enforce the Check Credit Use Case:
1. Customer.balance <= credit_limit
2. Customer.balance = Sum(Order.amount_total where date_shipped is null)
3. Order.amount_total = Sum(Item.amount)
4. Item.amount = quantity * unit_price
5. Store the Item.unit_price as a copy from Product.unit_price

Use Case: No Empty Orders
1. Order.item_count - Count(Items)
2. When setting the date_shipped, item_count must be > 0.
