Creates logic:

    # Logic from GenAI: (or, use your IDE w/ code completion)

    # Ensure that the total salaries of employees in a department do not exceed the department's budget.
    Rule.sum(derive=Department.total_salary, as_sum_of=Employee.salary)
    Rule.constraint(validate=Department,
                as_condition=lambda row: row.total_salary <= row.budget,
                error_msg="Department salaries ({row.total_salary}) exceed budget ({row.budget})")

    # End Logic from GenAI
