Airport - at least 10 tables

LogicBank
A airplane's passengers must be less than its seating capacity.


Invalid sum/count - no relationship to: Airplane in Derive Airplane.passenger_count as Count(<class 'database.models.Passenger'> Where None)

This is a correct message... passengers are about flights, not Airplane
So, reformulate the request:

Airport - at least 10 tables

LogicBank
A flight's passengers must be less than its Airplane's seating capacity.

This works...
1. Update an airplane's seating capacity, then
2. Alter a flight - observe constraint: Flight passenger count (150) exceeds airplane capacity (5)

Notes:
1. The constraint did not fire on step 1, since LogicBank did not cascade the change to Airplane->Flights
    - This is an issue for LogicBank, but the GenAI logic is correct.
