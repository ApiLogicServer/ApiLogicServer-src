Airport - at least 10 tables

LogicBank
A airplane's passengers must be less than its seating capacity.


Invalid sum/count - no relationship to: Airplane in Derive Airplane.passenger_count as Count(<class 'database.models.Passenger'> Where None)

This is a correct message... passengers are about flights, not Airplane
So, reformulate the request:

Airport - at least 10 tables

LogicBank
A flight's passengers must be less than its Airplane's seating capacity.

This works...
1. Update an airplane's seating capacity, then
2. Alter a flight - observe constraint: Flight passenger count (150) exceeds airplane capacity (5)

Notes:
1. The constraint did not fire on step 1, since LogicBank did not cascade the change to Airplane->Flights
    - This is possibly an issue for LogicBank, but the GenAI logic is correct.


Created logic:

    # Logic from GenAI: (or, use your IDE w/ code completion)

    # Derive the number of probations for a student.
    Rule.count(derive=Student.probation_count, as_count_of=Probation)

    # Derive the number of sick days for a student.
    Rule.count(derive=Student.sick_days_count, as_count_of=SickDay)

    # Signal an error if a Student's can-graduate is True, and there are more than 2 probations or more than 100 sick days.
    Rule.constraint(validate=Student,
                as_condition=lambda row: not row.can_graduate or (row.probation_count < 3 and row.sick_days_count <= 100),
                error_msg="Student ({row.name}) cannot graduate with {row.probation_count} probations and {row.sick_days_count} sick days.")

    # End Logic from GenAI
