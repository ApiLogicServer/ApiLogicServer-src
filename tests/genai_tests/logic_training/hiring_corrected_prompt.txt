Created incorrect logic - lost link to is-hirable

    # Logic from GenAI: (or, use your IDE w/ code completion)

    # Derives and enforces rules based on applicant's bankruptcy count.
    Rule.count(derive=Applicant.bankruptcy_count, as_count_of=Bankruptcy)
    Rule.constraint(validate=Applicant,
                as_condition=lambda row: row.bankruptcy_count <= 3,
                error_msg="Applicant cannot be hired due to too many bankruptcies")

    # Derives and enforces rules based on applicant's felony count.
    Rule.count(derive=Applicant.felony_count, as_count_of=Felony)
    Rule.constraint(validate=Applicant,
                as_condition=lambda row: row.felony_count <= 2,
                error_msg="Applicant cannot be hired due to too many felonies")

    # End Logic from GenAI


Change logic -- this worked:

Applicant have felonies and bankruptcies.

LogicBank
Signal error if is-hirable is true and there are more than 3 bankruptcies, or 2 felonies.


    # Logic from GenAI: (or, use your IDE w/ code completion)

    # Count number of bankruptcies per applicant.
    Rule.count(derive=Applicant.bankruptcy_count, as_count_of=Bankruptcy)

    # Count number of felonies per applicant.
    Rule.count(derive=Applicant.felony_count, as_count_of=Felony)

    # Ensure hirability rules regarding bankruptcies and felonies are enforced.
    Rule.constraint(validate=Applicant,
                    as_condition=lambda row: not (row.is_hirable and (row.bankruptcy_count > 3 or row.felony_count > 2)),
                    error_msg="Applicant is not hirable with more than 3 bankruptcies or 2 felonies.")

    # End Logic from GenAI
