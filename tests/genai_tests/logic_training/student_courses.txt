LogicBank:

Teachers, courses which have offerings, and students who have offerings.

LogicBank
Use Case: capacity
teachers cannot be assigned to more than 5 courses
students cannot have more enrollments than 6

Use Case: budget control
courses have a charge, which is copied to enrollments charge
a student's total enrollment charges cannot exceed their budget


Rules:

    # Ensures a teacher is not assigned more than 5 courses.
    Rule.count(derive=Teacher.course_count, as_count_of=Course)
    Rule.constraint(validate=Teacher,
                as_condition=lambda row: row.course_count <= 5,
                error_msg="Teacher has been assigned more than 5 courses")

    # Ensures a student does not enroll in more than 6 courses.
    Rule.count(derive=Student.enrollment_count, as_count_of=Offering)
    Rule.constraint(validate=Student,
                as_condition=lambda row: row.enrollment_count <= 6,
                error_msg="Student enrollment exceeds the allowed 6 courses")

    # Copies the charge from the course to the offering.
    Rule.copy(derive=Offering.charge, from_parent=Course.charge)

    # Ensures total charges of a studentâ€™s enrollments do not exceed their budget.
    Rule.sum(derive=Student.total_charges, as_sum_of=Offering.charge)
    Rule.constraint(validate=Student,
                as_condition=lambda row: row.total_charges <= row.budget,
                error_msg="Student's enrollment charges exceed budget")

Older comments:

    Poor result:
        - no Lookup on Students/Enrollments (never saw that before)
        - increased charge on course 1, enrollment did not trigger over-budget
