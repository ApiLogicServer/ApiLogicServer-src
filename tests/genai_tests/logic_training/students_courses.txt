Teachers, courses which have offerings, and students who have offerings.

LogicBank
Use Case: capacity
teachers cannot be assigned to more than 5 courses
students cannot have more enrollments than 6

Use Case: budget control
courses have a charge, which is copied to enrollments charge
a student's total enrollment charges cannot exceed their budget


Created Logic:

    # Logic from GenAI: (or, use your IDE w/ code completion)

    # Teachers cannot be assigned to more than 5 courses.
    Rule.count(derive=Teacher.course_count, as_count_of=Course)
    Rule.constraint(validate=Teacher,
    as_condition=lambda row: row.course_count <= 5,
    error_msg="Teacher has more than 5 course assignments ({row.course_count})")

    # Students cannot have more enrollments than 6.
    Rule.count(derive=Student.enrollment_count, as_count_of=Offering)
    Rule.constraint(validate=Student,
    as_condition=lambda row: row.enrollment_count <= 6,
    error_msg="Student has more than 6 enrollments ({row.enrollment_count})")

    # Courses have a charge, which is copied to enrollments charge.
    Rule.copy(derive=Offering.charge, from_parent=Course.charge)

    # A student's total enrollment charges cannot exceed their budget.
    Rule.sum(derive=Student.enrollment_charge_total, as_sum_of=Offering.charge)
    Rule.constraint(validate=Student,
    as_condition=lambda row: row.enrollment_charge_total <= row.budget,
    error_msg="Student enrollment charges ({row.enrollment_charge_total}) exceed budget ({row.budget})")

    # End Logic from GenAI



Older comments:

    Poor result:
        - no Lookup on Students/Enrollments (never saw that before)
        - increased charge on course 1, enrollment did not trigger over-budget
