Create a system with Employees and their Skills.
More than One Employee can have the same Skill.
EmployeeSkill.rating = Skill.rating

LogicBank
An Employee's skill-rating is the sum of the Employee Skills rating, plus 2 * years of service.

Creates incorrect Logic - copy vs formula

    # Logic from GenAI: (or, use your IDE w/ code completion)

    # Calculate skill_summary as the sum of skill ratings plus twice the years of service.
    Rule.sum(derive=Employee.skill_rating_total, as_sum_of=EmployeeSkill.rating)
    Rule.formula(derive=Employee.skill_summary, as_expression=lambda row: row.skill_rating_total + 2 * row.years_of_service)

    # Copy skill rating to employee skill.
    Rule.copy(derive=EmployeeSkill.rating, from_parent=Skill.rating)

    # End Logic from GenAI
