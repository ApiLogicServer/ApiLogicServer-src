Students have probations and sick days.

LogicBank
Signal an error if a Student's can-graduate is True, and there are more 2 probations, or more than 100 sick days.


Correct logic:

    # Logic from GenAI: (or, use your IDE w/ code completion)

    # Count the number of probations for each student.
    Rule.count(derive=Student.probation_count, as_count_of=Probation)

    # Count the number of sick days for each student.
    Rule.count(derive=Student.sick_days, as_count_of=SickDay)

    # Ensure students can only graduate with less than 3 probations and less than 101 sick days.
    Rule.constraint(validate=Student, as_condition=lambda row: not(row.can_graduate and (row.probation_count > 2 or row.sick_days > 100)), error_msg="Student cannot graduate with too many probations or sick days.")

    # End Logic from GenAI
