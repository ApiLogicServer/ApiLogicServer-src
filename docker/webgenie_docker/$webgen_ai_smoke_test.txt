The local-install version of builds are tested with...
    - Run Config: GenAI tests (at top)

After building the local wg, 
    1. Start: docker run -it --rm --name webgenie -p 8282:80  --env-file ./../../webg-config/web_genai.txt  -v ./../../webg-projects:/opt/projects apilogicserver/web_genai
    2. I test it by creating 2 projects, which mimic <manager>/README.md...


TEST 1
======

Create a system with customers, orders, items and products.

Include a notes field for orders.

Use LogicBank to create declare_logic() to enforce the Check Credit requirement (do not generate check constraints):
1. Customer.balance <= credit_limit
2. Customer.balance = Sum(Order.amount_total where date_shipped is null)
3. Order.amount_total = Sum(Item.amount)
4. Item.amount = quantity * unit_price
5. Store the Item.unit_price as a copy from Product.unit_price


Note: it may be required to 'dial this down' to 4 tables



TEST 2
======

* rename Customer to CustomerAccount
* each CustomerAccount can have multiple Addresses
* Add a SalesRep table
* each order has a salesrep

Note: you may need to adjust this, eg, if test 1 created CustomerAccount.
