Problem - ensure the $5000 for WebGenAI Docker is enforced:
    1. CE (Community Edition) requires restrictions (TBD - # rules, Security, ...)
    2. Licensed version works
    3. ALS continues to work as open src
    4. No / minimal impact on WebG

Proposed:
    1. WG Docker has env var: WG_LICENSED (not set for standard als)
    2. ALS start
        a. If WG_LICENSED, verify WG_KEY
            1. Missing: stops with "here's how to get a key"
            2. Community is free (with email)
        b. WG_KEY detects Pro vs Ent
            1. Enforced by with project start, and/or LogicBank


WebG Features:
    Security: required?
