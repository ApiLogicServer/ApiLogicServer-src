Problem - ensure the $5000 for WebGenAI Docker is enforced:
    1. CE (Community Edition) requires license
    2. Licensed version works
    3. ALS continues to work as open src
    4. No / minimal impact on WebG

Proposed:
    1. WG Docker has env var: WG_LICENSED (not set for standard als)
    2. ALS start
        a. If WG_LICENSED, verify WG_KEY
            1. Missing/expired: stops with "here's how to get a key"
                * or, runs read-only?
            2. CE License is free (with email)
        b. WG_KEY encodes 
            1. Pro vs Ent
            2. WG_KEY expires in 60 days


WebG Features:
    Security: required? extra cost?
